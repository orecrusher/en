## Charpy Impact Test 
Importance of impact test. The primary purpose of performing this experiment is to find whether the material is brittle or ductile. Materials that break without plastic deformation (no energy absorption) is known as a brittle material. Material breaks with large plastic deformation (little energy absorption) are known as ductile material.
