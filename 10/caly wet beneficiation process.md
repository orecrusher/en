Slimes and acidic water generated from the wet process require tailings ponds. Dewatering of the washed coal may cause leaching out of pollutants which in turn can cause ground water pollution if not managed properly. Wet cleaning is mostly used for metallurgical coals whereas there is a general trend to use dry beneficiation for thermal coals.
