## Using Coke Oven Gas in a Blast Furnace Saves Over $6 
Coke is an essential input to the steel-making process and is produced by heating coal in coke ovens. To make coke coal is heated in the absence of oxygen to drive volatile matter from it. Coke oven gas a low-BTU gas is produced as a by-product of the process. Approximately 40% of the COG is used as a fuel in the coke oven.
