3.1 Introduction. The unit cost of logging or road construction is essentially derived by dividing cost by production. In its simplest case if you rented a tractor with operator for $60 per hour - including all fuel and other costs - and you excavated 100 cubic meters per hour your unit cost for excavation would be $0.60 per cubic meter.
