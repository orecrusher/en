## Cement Kilns: Rotary kilns
Rotary Kiln Processes With the arrival of rotary kilns in Britain in 1900 cement manufacturing processes became sharply defined according to the form in which the raw materials are fed to the kiln. Raw materials were either ground with addition of water to form a slurry containing typically 30-45% water or they were ground dry to form a powder or "raw meal".
