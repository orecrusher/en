## What Are The Differences Between Single And Double Toggle 
 · The crushing process happens when the feed material between the two jaws is compressed. Another difference between the double toggle jaw crushers and the single ones is the position of the eccentric. In a double jaw crusher the eccentric is found behind the swinging jaw. That helps protect the eccentric from any further damages.

## Crushing 101 – Different types of crushers for distinctive 
 · A double toggle crusher has two shafts and two toggle plates. The first shaft is a pivoting shaft on the top of the crusher while the other is an eccentric shaft that drives both toggle plates. The chewing movement which causes compression at both material intake and discharge gives the single toggle jaw better capacity compared to a double toggle jaw of similar size.
