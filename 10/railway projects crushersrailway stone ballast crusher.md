Crushed stone works best since it acts as a sieve while providing a good support base. Like anything left in the weather ballast will acquire significant debris after years of exposure. A machine known as a ballast cleaner carries a singular job of cleaning these stones extending its life without the need of constant replacement.

The ballast is made using the rock we extract from the quarry which is crushed and sized to the required measurements. We then transport the stone from our railhead at Barrow-upon-Soar to Network Rail depots up and down the country. Our supply of rail ballast equates to around 70 per cent of Network Rail's total demand.
