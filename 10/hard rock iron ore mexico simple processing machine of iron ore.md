## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics
 · HistoryIron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore leaving behind a soft malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.

Waste rock is piled up at the surface near the edge of the open cut. This is known as the waste dump. The waste dump is also tiered and stepped to lessen degradation. Ore which has been processed is called as tailings and is normally slurry. This is pumped to a tailings dam or settling pond where the water fades away.

Miners used mechanical crushing and grinding machines to break up ores for further processing. Early miners used Mexican arrastras or stamp mills which reached their peak in the late nineteenth century to crush ores into sand-size particles. Before going to stamp mills ores often went through rock crushers which were like nutcrackers.
