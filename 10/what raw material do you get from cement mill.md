## Calculating a material waste factor 
If you're adding on a percentage to your net material requirement for costing don't add a "waste" factor or you'll be making a mistake I see lots of guys do. If your waste factor is 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% or 50% add 26 34 44 55 67 82 and 100 percent respectively to your net material requirement to get your actual material costs.
