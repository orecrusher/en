Kiln: Big oven for making of cement. LSF: Lime saturation factor. A higher LSF means higher specific energy consumption the material becomes harder to burn. Clinker: The product is taken out of the kiln and is later on ground to cement. Clinker factor: This is a fraction of what is put into the cyclone system as raw meal and taken out as clinker.

The clinker burning process is operated in counter flow principle. The raw meal is fed to the top of preheater cyclones where it is heated up to approximately 930°C by the kiln exhaust gas. It is burned in the rotary kiln with flames of 2000°C where a series of chemical reactions take place resulting in the formation of clinker and the release of CO2.

Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln which transforms it into clinker which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement and has a large effect upon the

## Recoverable Quantity of Waste Heat from Kiln and Preheater 
Where mkf= mass of kiln feed Ckf =specific heat of kiln feed With kiln feed of typical lime saturation and calcium carbonate content the kiln feed to clinker factor would be expected to be around 1.54 due to loss of CO2 from the CaCO3. That factor is increased by the dust losses from the preheater to the raw mill and dust filters.

## Energy optimization in cement manufacturing
Cement manufacturing is a complex and energy-intensive process. A key stage in this process is the conversion of ground raw materials (CaCO 3 clay and/or shale) into clinker (synthetic cementitious minerals) in the kiln. A typical operation uses kiln exhaust gases to preheat the raw materials before they enter the kiln. Further
