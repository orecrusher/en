## Lead and Zinc 
Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S. Mining Industry 6 Lead and Zinc Lead and zinc ores are usually found together with gold and silver. A lead-zinc ore may also contain lead sulfide zinc sulfide iron sulfide iron carbonate and quartz. When zinc and lead sulfides are present in profitable amounts they are regarded as ore minerals.

## Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) Production and Manufacturing Process
 · Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) Production and Manufacturing Process. TiO2 is produced from either ilmenite rutile or titanium slag. Titanium pigment is extracted by using either sulphuric acid (sulphate process) or chlorine (chloride route). The sulphate process employs simpler technology than the chloride route and can use lower grade cheaper ores.

In this process copper ore is mined crushed ground concentrated smelted and refined. The mining crushing and grinding portions of the processing are extremely energy intensive since the rock must be reduced essentially to talcum powder fineness in order to separate the copper-bearing minerals from it.

## Extraction of Resources 
Once the analysis determines a given ore body is worth recovering development begins to create access to the ore body. The mine buildings and processing plants are built and any necessary equipment is obtained. The operation of the mine to recover the ore begins and continues as long as the company operating the mine finds it economical to do so.

## Zinc smelting 
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals e.g. iron because in contrast zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost unless specific
