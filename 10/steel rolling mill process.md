 · During rolling in these mills the grains which deform during the process of rolling recrystallize maintain an equiaxed microstructure and prevent the metal from work hardening. In this type of rolling hot rolled metals have very little directionality in the mechanical properties and deformation induced residual stresses.

Working Principle of Rolling Process: The rolling process is a metal forming process in which stock of the material is passed between one or more pairs of rollers in order to reduce and to maintain the uniform thickness. This process is mainly focused on the cross-section of the ingot or the metal which is forming.

## What Is a Temper Mill? (with picture) 
The metal forming method at a temper mill involves rolling the sheets of steel through what is known as a cold reducing process or temper pass. This increases the density of the steel by reducing its overall thickness between usually 1.5% to 2% without allowing the steel to spread out while under pressure.

## Steckel mill 
A Steckel mill also known as a reversible finishing mill [citation needed] is similar to a reversing rolling mill except two coilers are used to feed the material through the mill. One coiler is on the entrance side and the other on the exit side. The coilers pull the material through the mill therefore the process is more similar to drawing than rolling.

As many as 15 passes may be required to reduce an ingot 21 in 2 (135 cm 2) in cross section to a bloom 8 in 2 (52 cm 2) in cross section. The twoand three-high blooming mills roll the top and bottom of the steel in every pass.
