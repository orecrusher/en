## Cell isolation 
Cell isolation is the process of separating individual living cells from a solid block of tissue or cell suspension. While some types of cell naturally exist in a separated form (for example blood cells) other cell types that are found in solid tissue require specific techniques to separate them into individual cells. This may be performed by using enzymes to digest the proteins that binds

## Cell Separation: Overview of Cell Isolation and Separation 
Cell Separation by Filtration Filtration is a cell isolation technology based on size. Using a filtration device targeted cells are captured while other cells pass through the device. Leaving the experimenter with one population at the bottom of the filtration device or medium and the other population caught before or within it.

## Cell Separation and Cell Isolation Methods
Immunomagnetic cell separation is a technique whereby magnetic particles are used to isolate target cells from heterogeneous mixtures. To accomplish this the magnetic particles are bound to specific cell surface proteins on the target cells via antibodies enzymes lectins or streptavidin. The sample is then placed in an electromagnetic field that pulls on the magnetic particles bringing the labeled cells

## Fractionation of Cells 
Although biochemical analysis requires disruption of the anatomy of the cell gentle fractionation techniques have been devised to separate the various cell components while preserving their individual functions. Just as a tissue can be separated into its living constituent cell types so the cell can be separated into its functioning organelles and macromolecules.

Similar to depletion the negative cell separation approach is when several cell types are removed to leave one cell type untouched. A negative selection example is the depletion of all cells except for T cells or the removal of all cells except for B cells from samples like whole blood or bone marrow.
