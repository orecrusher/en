Molybdenum Beneficiation Basis Overview The beneficiation processing of molybdenum ore is mainly performed by flotation and the recovered molybdenum mineral is molybdenite(MoS2). Sometimes in order to improve the quality of molybdenum concentrate and remove impurities the concentrated molybdenite would be subjected to a further step of chemical beneficiation processing.
