 · Grinding mills used in the mining industries are the most energy-intensive operation and require a large number of wear resistant materials as well. The 1-m mill was used to investigate the effects of three lifter configurations namely Hi (High) Rail and Hi-Lo (High-Low) and mill speeds on the mill performance.

The power consumption is usually determined by charge fill level lifter height lifter number and mill speed. However almost all of the classical theories for calculating the power consumption of ball mills disregard the effect of lifters and only focus on rotation rate charge fill level as well as size and shape of grinding media thereby may causing errors.

Ball nosed cutters: slow nose speed. The biggest challenge with ball nosed end mills of various kinds is slow nose speed. As you get closer to the tip the diameter on the ball gets smaller and smaller finally going to zero. As a result the cutter must perform over a wide range of surface speeds and chip loads at different depths in the cut.
