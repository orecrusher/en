## Clinkerization 
In order to increase heat utilization in kiln system six stage cyclones are as well installed in many cement plants. However increasing cyclone stages beyond six does not look economic any more as the quantum of heat saving is not significant to justify it moreover the increased pressure drop across preheater outbalances the improvements due to additional cyclone.

## ppt of cement kiln feedback system 
Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of Portland and other types of hydraulic cement in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica-bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silies.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant.
