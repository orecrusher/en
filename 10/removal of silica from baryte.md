Selectively leaching the iron-removed bauxite residues. Bauxite residue (BR) is a hazardous industrial waste and also becomes an important reserve of rare earth elements (REE) An elegant process for achieving separation of REEs against silica from an iron-removed BR was established in this paper through selective leaching of silica with simultaneous enrichment of REEs.

## Silica removal from water 
 · A. Silica can be removed from raw water easily with standard demineralization techniques. Normally silica is present in a weak acidic form. Ion exchange will remove this as long as the anion resin is the strong base type. Silica in deionized water can easily be reduced to 20-50 ppb. Reverse osmosis will also remove silica by 90-98%.
