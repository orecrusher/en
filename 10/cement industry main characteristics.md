## Explained: Cement vs. concrete — their differences and 
 · Cement production begins with limestone a sedimentary rock. Once quarried it is mixed with a silica source such as industrial byproducts slag or fly ash and gets fired in a kiln at 2700 degrees Fahrenheit. What comes out of the kiln is called clinker. Cement plants grind clinker down to an extremely fine powder and mix in a few additives.
