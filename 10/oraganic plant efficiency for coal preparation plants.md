Coal preparation is often required in order to produce clean efficient "thermal" coal for steam generation or to produce high quality "metallurgical" coal suitable for coking (Pitt and Millward 1979; Lu et al. 2012). In order to complete this requirement ash minerals (e.g. sulfur and ash) must be removed.

## Coal combustion and electricity generation efficiency 
Why energy efficiency? Much effort is currently being focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power generation. However it is just as important to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2) that ends up in the waste flue gas that comes out of the flue stack of a power station.This is done by improving the efficiency of the coal combustion process.
