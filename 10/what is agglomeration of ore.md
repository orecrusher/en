## Understanding the agglomeration behavior of nickel 
ore agglomeration has been highlighted (Bouffard 2005). Published literature regarding the control and modeling stud-ies of crushed ore agglomeration is very limited. The reasons may be the lack of understanding of the process experimental difficulties and also the ambiguous role of size.

Agglomeration of ore into coarse porous masses achieves this even distribution of fluids by preventing fine particles from migrating and clogging the spaces and channels between the larger ore particles. Binders are critically necessary to produce agglomerates that will not break down during processing.

## Difference Between Agglomeration and Deglomeration 
 · The key difference between agglomeration and deglomeration is that agglomeration is the process of aggregation whereas deglomeration is the process of breakdown of aggregates.. Agglomeration and deglomeration are two chemical processes that are opposite to each other. Agglomeration refers to the formation of large masses via the combination of small masses.
