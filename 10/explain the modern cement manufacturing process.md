How Concrete is Made. In its simplest form concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates or rocks. The paste composed of portland cement and water coats the surface of the fine (small) and coarse (larger) aggregates. Through a chemical reaction called hydration the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rock-like mass known as concrete.

## The Steel Manufacturing Process 
 · The modern-day steel production process began in 1856 under a process known as the Bessemer process. It's largely considered to be the first process used to mass-produce steel. According to historians two different inventors one in the UK and one in Pittsburgh both simultaneously developed a steel production process that involved removing iron's impurities through the use of an air blast.
