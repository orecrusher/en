## Coal Gasifiion and Its Appliions 
Coal is used primarily as a fuel so its most important property is its heat of combustion. Gross calorific value also known as higher heating value (HHV) is determined by measuring the heat released when coal is burned in a constant-volume calorimeter with an intitial oxygen pressure of 2 to 4 MPA and when the combustion products are cooled to a final temperature between 20 and 35°C.

## What are the different types of coal? 
The coal formation process involves the burial of peat which is made of partly decayed plant materials deep underground. The heat and pressure of burial alters the texture and increases the carbon content of the peat which transforms it into coal a type of sedimentary rock. This process takes millions of years. Types or "ranks" of coal are determined by carbon content.
