## Extracting Gold 
Removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.

## Mineral Deposit Value 
As you can see in the example above the deposit does not have to be enormous in size (only 500 meters long by 100 meters wide) to contain a valuable deposit (approximately $6 billion worth of minerals). However in order to be as realistic as possible about this valuation you can not assume that the complete ore body contains the same grade (i.e. 2% copper and 1.5 gram per tonne gold).

The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.

## Methods of Gold Mining 
Gold is also produced by mining in which it is not the principal product. Large copper mines such as the Bingham Canyon mine in Utah often recover considerable amounts of gold and other metals along with copper. Some sand and gravel pits such as those around Denver Colorado may recover small amounts of gold

## How copper is made 
The resulting mixture called a copper concentrate contains about 25-35% copper along with various sulfides of copper and iron plus smaller concentrations of gold silver and other materials. The remaining materials in the tank are called the gangue or tailings.

Generally copper extraction follows the sequence (see Figure below): 1. Beneficiation by froth flotation of ore to give copper concentrate (Optional partial roasting to obtain oxidized material or calcines) 2. Two-stage pyrometallurgical extraction 1. smelting concentrates to matte 2. converting matte by oxidation to crude (converter or

## Mercury Amalgamation and Fine Gold Recovery 
 · In the 1800's the use of mercury to extract gold from ore (called Amalgamation) was the most commonly used method by small scale prospectors for this purpose. It has been a highly controversial method of extraction to say the least because of both the physical and environmental health risks that mercury poses. Individual prospectors will []

## The environmental impact of gold production
However gold is produced in much smaller quantities so the total environmental footprint for global gold production is smaller than some other commonly used metals including steel copper and aluminium. The stages that contributed the most to gold's environmental impact were mining and comminution (crushing and grinding of the ore).

The finely ground material is treated in two mineral floatation circuits to extract the copper gold and silver as a copper concentrate. A portion of gold is also separately captured utilising a gravity gold circuit. The concentrate is then piped 156 kilometres south
