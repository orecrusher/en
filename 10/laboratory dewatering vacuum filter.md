## Rotary Drum Vacuum Filter 
These can range from laboratory scale to full production scale. For our smaller scale rotary drum vacuum filters we have designed and developed two different sized filters the Rotavac Lab and the Rotavac One. The Rotavac One is a complete compact pilot filter station. The Rotavac Lab is a laboratory scale rotary vacuum filter.

## Laboratory Vacuum Filter Model: VACUFAN 
VACUFAN-1 has been built for dewatering and filtration of laboratory samples in vacuum conditions. The pulp is poured in a special and lattice funnel in which filter paper is placed. Resulted vacuum pressure in an Erlenmeyer Flask causes the liquefied gas to pass through the filter and. be collected in the Erlenmeyer Flask.

## Choose the best sludge dewatering method
Mechanical dewatering is the use of mechanical equipment for sludge dewatering. Compared with natural drying it has less land occupation and less stench. There are various technologies for mechanical sludge dewatering: vacuum filtration dewatering pressure filtration dewatering centrifugal dewatering screw press dewatering.
