## Grate 
Grates are foreground blocks which allow liquids to fall through while remaining solid for everything else acting like a drainage system. Grates can be toggled open and closed when triggered via wire. An open Grate is transparent allowing light and liquid through while a closed Grate is opaque and acts as a solid block. If a Grate is triggered while liquid is passing through it the Grate

2 thoughts on " How It Works – Broaching " Slater Broach March 24 2010 at 1:44 pm. Rotary Broaching also works on mills and VMCs. At least one half of the set-up needs to be turning either the tool or the broach. Broaching tools used in mills can also be fixtured with Broaching Orientation Dogs to align the holes to part features.

## WOA1 
A pulp lifter for a grate discharge mill used primarily in mining operations. The lifter comprises a plurality of chambers which radiate outwards. Each chamber comprises a transitional compartment (2) having apertures (19) into which the slurry enters and a collection compartment (21) to which the slurry passes. When the pulp lifter rotates the slurry cannot flow back but must pass to the

## Diffraction Grating 
Diffraction Grating When there is a need to separate light of different wavelengths with high resolution then a diffraction grating is most often the tool of choice. This "super prism" aspect of the diffraction grating leads to appliion for measuring atomic spectra in both laboratory instruments and telescopes.

## How does a Diffraction grating work? 
 · Gratings that have many lines very close to each other can have very small slit spacing. For example a grating ruled with 5000 lines/cm has a slit spacing d=1/5000 cm=2.00×10-4 cm. A section of a diffraction grating is illustrated in the figure. A plane wave is an incident from the left normal to the plane of the grating.
