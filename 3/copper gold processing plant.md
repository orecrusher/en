## Limits of the CIL circuit in copper–gold plants 
 · When low quality ores are processed and the gold price is decreased many copper–gold plants have to close the CIL circuit and discharge flotation tailings directly to the tailing dams. To recover the gold from flotation tailings it is important to understand limits of the CIL circuit and then develop an economically viable process.
