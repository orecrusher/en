## Copper Mining and Extraction 
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silie carbonate or sulphate ores.

Copper mining. The main stages. Copper minerals and ore are found throughout the Earth's crust. They occur in both sedimentary and igneous rocks. The outer 10km of the crust contains 33g of copper for every tonne of rock. This is not enough to make it commercially viable to extract the rock. Copper mines are only set up where there is more than

## Opencast Mining 
Coal is mined either by surface methods (open-cut or open-cast mining) or by underground techniques. In surface mining all of the rock from the ground surface to the top of the seam (material referred to as overburden) is removed and set aside to expose the coal which is then taken out and transported from the mine for preparation and use ( Figure 11 ).

Open pit mining. Open pit mining where material is excavated from an open pit is one of the most common forms of mining for strategic minerals. This type of mining is particularly damaging to the environment because strategic minerals are often only available in small concentrations which increases the amount of ore needed to be mined.
