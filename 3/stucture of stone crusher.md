 · Table given below shows the crushing strength of various stones. Due to non-uniformity of the material usually a factor of safety of 10 is used to find the permissible stress in a stone. Hence even laterite can be used safely for a single storey building because in such structures expected load can hardly give a stress of 0.15 N/mm 2 .

## Environmental GUIDELINE ON STONE CRUSHING plant
A stone crushing plant is primarily involved in the manufacture of aggregates of various sizes (coarse aggregates crusher run rock sand and other fine aggregates) from basalt boulders. Coarse aggregates are usually used in ready mix concrete and asphaltic concrete. Crusher run is used for the bases and sub-bases for road making.

 · Crushed stone or coarse gravel acts as an effective capillary break and sheet polyethylene in direct contract with a concrete floor slab acts as an effective vapor barrier. The concrete slab should be sealed to the perimeter basement wall with sealant (the concrete slab becomes the "air barrier" that controls the flow of soil gas into the basement).

 · I have a question about 3/4" crushed stone. I read several places that 3/4" crushed stone is "self-compacting". That is you dump it in a trech (as in under a concrete footing or floor) and you don't have to compact it with a plate compactor - it is already as "compacted" as it needs to be.
