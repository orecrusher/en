## Metallurgy 
Crushing and Grinding: The primary process involved in the metallurgy of metals is pulverization which involves the crushing of ores into fine powder in a crusher. 2. The Concentration of Ores: The ores extracted from the earth's crust contains a large number of unwanted impurities called gangue mixed with them such as like quartz silies sand feldspar mica etc.
