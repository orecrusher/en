Extraction of Metals. What is a Metal Ore?. A solid element or compound which occurs naturally in the Earth's crust is called a mineral.A mineral which contains a high enough percentage of a metal for economic extraction is called a metal ore. Economic extraction means that the cost of getting the metal out of the ore is sufficiently less than the amount of money made by selling the metal.

## Extraction of zinc
The possibility of recovery of zinc and zinc-containing compounds from real technogenic waste metallurgical sludge containing about 1.0% zinc by a filtration combustion method was studied. This method due to its features is distinguished by low energy consumption and can be effectively applied in cases where the use of traditional methods is economically unjustified.
