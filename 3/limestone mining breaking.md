## Advantages Disadvantages of Limestone 
Limestone is a common rock composed of the mineral calcite. Calcite comes primarily from the shells of organisms such as corals and clams. When these sea creatures die their shells pile up into debris. This then forms limestone beds which is compressed over thousands of years to create limestone.

A lime kiln is a kiln used for the calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce the form of lime called quicklime (calcium oxide).The chemical equation for this reaction isCaCO 3 + heat → CaO + CO 2. This reaction can take place at anywhere above 840 °C (1544 °F) but is generally considered to occur at 900 °C(1655 °F) (at which temperature the partial pressure of CO 2 is 1

Some Issues in Limestone Mining. Limestone is most often mined from a quarry. However underground limestonemines are found at places in the central and eastern United States especially in and near cities. Underground mining of lime - stone has some advantages over surface quarrying and will probably increase in the future.
