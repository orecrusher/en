 · The particle size achieved from a bead mill is a direct function of the media size used for the grinding process. The average particle size that can be achieved quickly in a bead mill is about 1/1000 the size of the grinding media. Figure 1 illustrates this point. In this experiment we processed limestone using two different media sizes: 0.4-0

 · As the name implies the grinding media in these mills are steel balls. The particles size of the feed usually does not exceed 2.5 cm. The grinding is carried out by balls being carried up the side of the mill such that they release and fall to the point where they impact the ore particles in trailing bottom region of the slurry.

particles can interfere with separation processes such as froth flotation and might result in loss of valuable components. In other operations the objective might be to produce very fine particles. Sometimes as in sugar grinding very fine particles are agglomerated to increase the share of larger particles.
