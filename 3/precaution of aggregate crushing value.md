## Aggregate Crushing Value Test 
The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with the plunger on top.
