## A CONTACT LENGTH MODEL FOR GRINDING WHEEL
Grinding efficiency and workpiece surface integrity are greatly affected by deflections that occur within the grinding contact zone. A new relationship for the contact between the grinding wheel and the surface of the workpiece is introduced by the equation 1c2 = li2 + 1g2.
