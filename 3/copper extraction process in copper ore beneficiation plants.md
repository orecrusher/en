## Copper Ore Hydrometallurgy and Pressure Leaching
Copper hydrometallurgy is a branch of metallurgy method to extract copper directly from those difficult-to-concentrate copper oxide ore. Traditional copper hydrometallurgy process typically consists of atmospheric leaching solvent extraction (SX) and electro-winning (EW). It can produce either copper hode or copper sulphate crystal.
