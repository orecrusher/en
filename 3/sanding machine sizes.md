## Belt Sanders Guide: What They Are and How to Use 
 · Sanders with 4-in.-wide belts are heavy-duty machines best left to cabinetmakers. Pick a belt but not any belt. Personally I use 80- and 120-grit belts regularly and rarely 50-grit. Grits coarser than 50 leave deep scratches that are difficult to remove. And if you're doing finer sanding you're better off using a random-orbit sander.
