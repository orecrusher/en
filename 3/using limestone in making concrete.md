Limestone is also the main constituent of cement and concrete. In cement making. Cement is made by first mixing limestone and substances such as clays (which contain silica alumina and iron(III) oxide) to a fine powder. The mixture is crushed and fed into a rotary kiln which is an iron pipe 60-90 m long and approximately 6 m in diameter.

## using limestone in making concrete 
using limestone in making concrete. Limestone quality should have at least 75% calcium carbonate by mass a clay content less than 1.2% by mass and an organic content less than 0.2% by mass. There are several advantages to using limestone in portland cement such as reduced energy consumption and reduced CO 2 emissions.

 · The limestone acts as a seed crystal for the cement better distributing the reaction products and increasing the reactivity of the cement. As there is always unhydrated cement in the concrete this change will have no real measurable effect on the use of fly ash. The cement might have a reduced water demand and the coarser cement gradation
