## Different between slow sand filter(SSF) and rapid sand 
The difference in water level in the filter basin and outlet chamber is filter head. For a slow sand filter it works maximum up to 75 cm or 65 % to 85 % of the thickness of filter media. In the beginning the filter head is only 10-15 cm. Cleaning of filter media:-. For cleaning water in the tank is first drained off.

63 The general features of slow and rapid filters are summarised in Table 6.1. Slow sand filters are conventionally operated at a filtration rate in the range 0.1-0.2 m 3m-2h-1 (approximately 0.029 mm s-1) and rely to great extent on the formation of a biological layer or 'Schmutzdecke' for their cleansing

## Slow Sand filter 
Slow sand filtration has been used successfully in Europe since the early 1900s and is still a popular method of treating municipal water supplies. Research and other observations show that slow sand filtration can effectively remove cysts and coliform bacteria from raw water and is an innovative cost effective low maintenance treatment
