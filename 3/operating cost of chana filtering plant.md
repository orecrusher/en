A thousand gallons of fresh-water from a desalination plant cost the average US consumer $2.50 to $5 Pankratz says compared to $2 for conventional freshwater. It's also an energy hog: Desalination plants around the world consume more than 200 million kilowatt-hours each day with energy costs an estimated 55 percent of plants' total operation and maintenance costs.

3.1 Introduction. The unit cost of logging or road construction is essentially derived by dividing cost by production. In its simplest case if you rented a tractor with operator for $60 per hour - including all fuel and other costs - and you excavated 100 cubic meters per hour your unit cost for excavation would be $0.60 per cubic meter.
