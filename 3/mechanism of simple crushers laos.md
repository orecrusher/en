 · Cam mechanisms can realize any required output motion. The composition of a cam mechanisms is simple: a cam a follower and a frame. (You may find springs used in a cam mechanism to keep the follower and the cam in contact but it is not part of the cam mechanism.) 2.1 Rotating cam/Translating follower. If you turn the cam the follower will move.

## Design and make a model of a machine to crush grain
A machine to crush grain will usually be powered by an electrical motor that provides rotational movement. You will not use an electrical motor in your model but will rather turn the handle of a crank by hand. This rotational movement should be changed into a reciproing movement so that the grain will be crushed like hitting it with a hammer.
