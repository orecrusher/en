## How to Refine Gold: 2 Major Techniques of Gold Refining 
Two (2) major techniques for refining gold. Generally gold can be refined using these two-best-known gold-refining procedures: Aqua Regia and gold electrolysis. Both of these techniques can be used to separate gold from other metals. This is because a little piece of other metals in gold can change its properties and value.

## Refining Of Gold Bearing Ores Process
Refining of gold bearing ores process The Gold Smelting Process Refining Gold Smelting is not always the final stage in gold extraction Depending on the intended use of the gold it may have to be refined before being put to use Refining gold is simply the process of removing the finer impurities that the smelting process could not remove.

## Establishing thE ProcEss MinEralogy of gold orEs
gold ores: Antimony bismuth sulfide and telluride gold ores are often somewhat refractory due to the presence of slow-dissolving gold minerals such as aurostibite maldonite and gold tellurides. Carbonaceous ores: The gold is fine and usually is predominantly associated with the sulfides (pyrite or arsenopyrite) that are present in carbonaceous

## Gold parting 
Gold parting is the separating of gold from silver.Gold and silver are often extracted from the same ores and are chemically similar and therefore hard to separate. Over the centuries special means of separation have been invented. The very earliest precious metals had mixes of gold and silver; gold and silver alloy is called electrum.With the advent of coinage methods had to be invented to

 · That's enough to make 20 gold pieces from a ton of ore so if we discount the costs of refining and minting 100 pounds of unrefined gold ore should be worth about 1gp give or take a few coppers. Yeah that's not much fun. I suggest making something about the ore "special" to increase its value or substituting another reward.

 · Arsenic alloyed with gold-silver alloys aids rather than hinders dissolution of gold in cyanide solution and such could be ruled out as a cause of refractory behavior of gold-bearing arsenical ores. The presence of particles of precious metal in cyanide solution residues remains unexplained. Cyanidation and concentration of gold and silver ores
