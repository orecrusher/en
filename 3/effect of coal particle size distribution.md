## Effects of Particle Size Distribution and Oxygen 
 · For different coal particle size distributions the variation of flame propagation velocity with time in general displays an "M"-shaped curve. The curve of flame propagation velocity vs time is single-peaked at 40% oxygen concentration for both coarse and fine particles with mean diameters of 82 and 16 μm respectively.

Measurements of the particle size distribution at the outlets of six coal-fired utility boilers showed a peak at a particle diameter near 0.1 micrometer. This submicrometer mode appears to be a general feature of coal combustion that results from a volatilization-condensation process in the boiler. At the boilers tested the submicrometer mode contained 0.2 to 2.2 percent of the total fly ash
