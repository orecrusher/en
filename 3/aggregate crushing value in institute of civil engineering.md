## Aggregate crushing value test 
It is recommended that the crushing value of aggregate should be less than 30%. If it is more than 30 % then 10% finer aggregate is suggested to use. The aggregate whose crushing value is less than 30% can be used for cement concrete road. The aggregate whose crushing value is less than 40% can be used for wearing surface.

Aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load. Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions.
