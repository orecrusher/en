You may also encounter "crushed gravel" which is simply larger gravel particles crushed to a smaller desired size. Gravel is usually sold with a guaranteed maximum particle size e.g. 10mm 20mm. This means that no side of any particle will be larger than the specified measurement which is achieved through screening usually using industrial automated screeners.
