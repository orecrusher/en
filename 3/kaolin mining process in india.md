## Kaolin Mining and Processing
 · The kaolin slurry is pumped from the mines to the plant into large terminal tanks in a dispersed state. The common dispersants used are the sodium polyphosphates and sodium silie. The first step in the wet process is to fractionate the kaolin slurry into a coarse and fine fraction through continuous centrifuges or by settling in large hydroseparators or vats.
