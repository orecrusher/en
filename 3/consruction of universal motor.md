## How does a universal motor work? 
Universal motors have high starting torque can run at high speed and are lightweight and compact. What is universal motor why so called it? A universal motor is a special type of motor which is designed to run either on DC or single phase AC supply. Universal Motors are so named because they can run both on AC as well as DC.

## Ac Series Motor 
 · An ordinary d.c.series motor will run in the same direction regardless of the polarity of the supply. The direction of the torque depends upon the relative directions in space of flux and armature current. If the line terminals be reversed both the field and armature current are reversed the direction of torque remains unchanged.

## Universal Motor – Construction Working Characteristics
 · Construction of Universal Motor : Generally there is no constructional difference between a universal motor and an ac series motor. We know that modifiions are done to the dc series motor to work as an ac series motor. Similarly small ratings (less than 1 kW) of such motors are known as universal motors.

As shown in Fig. 2 the construction of the single phase and three-phase induction motors includes a stator where the primary winding is wound and a basket-shaped solid aluminum die cast rotor. The rotor is low-cost because the structure is simple and does not use a magnet.

## Universal Motors 
A universal motor is defined as a motor which may be operated on either d.c. or single phase a.c. supply at very high speed in the range of 3000 to 7000 rpm or so. It has starting torque and variable speed characteristics. Universal motor are designed for weak field to minimize commutation difficulties.

## construction of universal motor 
A universal motor is a series-wound motor — meaning that the field and armature windings are connected in series — and is mechanically commutated with brushes and a commutator. Although its construction is very similar to a series-wound DC motor a universal motor incorporates several modifiions that allow it operate properly on either DC or AC power supply. get price

 · The universal motor is very similar to a DC series motor in construction but is modified slightly to allow the motor to operate properly on AC power. This type of electric motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field coils and the armature (and the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) synchronously with the supply.

The armature of universal motor is of the same construction as ordinary series motor. In order to minimize commutation problems high resistance brushes with increased brush area are used. The universal motor is simply and cheap. It is used usually for rating not greater than 750 W. The characteristics of universal motor are very much similar
