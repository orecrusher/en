## Nice Guy Concrete 
Exposed aggregate concrete is comparable to a slide of granite or marble that is beautifully transformed through polishing. A plain dull surface can be carefully stripped to reveal the unique colors and shapes of pebbles lying beneath.The decorative process of exposing aggregate has been repeated since the early 1900s- well before pattern stamping.

## Exposed Aggregate Concrete 
 · An exposed-aggregate surface is obtained by placing concrete and then removing the outer 'skin' of cement paste to uncover decorative coarse aggregate (either batched into the concrete mix or seeded onto the surface). Because of its durability and skid resistance an exposed aggregate finish is ideal for most flatwork including: Sidewalks.

Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock boulders cobbles or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases soil-cement and in new concrete. After harvesting aggregate is processed: crushed screened and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.
