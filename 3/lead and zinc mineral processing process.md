Lead is extracted from ores dug from under-ground mines. Lead is also found in conjunction with other metals such as silver and zinc. Lead materials are mined as a by- product of these other more valuable metals. Extracting the lead materials from the ore is a tedious process. First the lead ore is ground into small salt-like particles.

As main gangue minerals calcite dolomite and some silies are present in both ore types. Before 1960 the lead-vanadate-containing ore from different ore bodies was processed using gravity concentration. The processing plant for flotation of lead zinc and vanadate minerals was introduced by the end of 1961 and closed in 1978.
