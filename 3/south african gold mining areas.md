## Decoding the Hidden Ruins of Southern Africa – Discovering 
In my personal experience and research I have found at least 25 ancient mine shafts in gold-rich areas and been told about dozens more by farmers all over South Africa.

## A century of migrant labour in the gold mines of South Africa
A century of migrant labour in the gold mines of South Africa took place all over southern Africa4 with stringent health checks before miners were accepted. In addition to the inherent dangers of work underground—in 1907 mortality ran at 470 per 100 000 employees per annum 2—were the recognized dangers of high pre-existing pneumonia rates.

 · In 2013 mining companies produced 562000 times as much waste as gold according to the South African Chamber of Mines. A decade before that same ratio was less than half as large at to-1. Mining operations are generating increased waste because South Africa's gold is running out and the remaining resource only can be found several miles below ground.
