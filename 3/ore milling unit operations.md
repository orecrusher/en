Machining is a very common and versatile manufacturing process. Thus it's possible to machine various types of material using these three methods.

## Ball Mill 
As mentioned earlier pebble mills are widely used in the North American taconite iron ore operations. Since the weight of pebbles per unit volume is 35–55% of that of steel balls and as the power input is directly proportional to the volume weight of the grinding medium the power input and capacity of pebble mills are correspondingly lower.

 · These factors often translate to a higher unit power input (kWh/t) than an SAG circuit milling the same ore. but at a higher power efficiency (often assessed by the operating work index OWi which if used most objectively should be corrected by one of a number of techniques for varying amounts of fines between the two milling operations).

## Determining Stripping Ratio 
 · The maximum allowable Stripping Ratio (SR max) defines break even stripping ratio (BESR).This represents the highest possible units of waste that can be handled. If the SR exceeds the BESR then the operation will be uneconomical as the income generated by the ore is insufficient to offset the costs incurred in mining.
