## Yes You Can Make Your Own Ceramic Tiles
 · A lovely festive idea is to make small square ceramic tiles and paint them with Christmas scenes. Pop a hole in the top (big enough to thread string through) and hang them up on the Christmas tree. It's a great Christmas activity to do with children and if you coat a clear glaze on top of the Christmas decoration you'll be able to re-hang them on the Christmas tree for years to come.
