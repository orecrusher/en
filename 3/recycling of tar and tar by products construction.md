## How to Recycle Asphalt – RecycleNation
 · RecycleNation's Recycle Search tool can also help you find an asphalt recycler in your community. It is a good idea to make sure any asphalt you take to a recycler is free of other materials such as wood and metal. Also if you are recycling asphalt shingles make sure the recycler will take them and does not only accept pieces of asphalt paving.
