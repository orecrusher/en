The volumetric proportioning of sand is greatly affected by bulking of sand to a greater extent. The affected volume will be great for fine sand and will be less for coarse sand. If proper allowance is not made for the bulking of sand the cost of concrete and mortar increases and it results into under-sanded mixes which are harsh and difficult for working and placing.

Assume you are using dry gravel with a swell percentage of 15% and a shrink percentage of -7%. Plug those values into the calculator and it will tell you that the compaction factor = 1.237. Multiply the 1185 cubic yards by 1.237. 1185  1.237 = 1465.9. To complete this job you will need 1465.9 cubic yards of this gravel in loose state volume.

## BULKING OF FINE AGGREGATE 
 · Since the volume of the saturated sand is the same as that of the dry sand the saturated sand completely offsets the bulking effect. Note down the level of sand say h 2. Subtract the final level h2 from initial level h1 (i.e. h 1-h 2) which shows the bulking of sand under test. Calculate percentage of bulking using formula given below.

 · Swell Factors for Various Soils. A cubic yard of earth measured in its natural position swells to more than a cubic yard after it is excavated. This occurs because of an increase in voids. Swell is expressed as a percentage of natural volume for example if 10 yd 3 in the ground becomes 13 yd 3 after excavation the swell factor is 30%.
