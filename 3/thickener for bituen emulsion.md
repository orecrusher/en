## Bitumen emulsion manufacturing process 
Bitumen emulsion manufacturing process consists of two stages: first preparation of the water phase and then emulsion production. The water phase is prepared in a special tank with water emulsifier acid (or alkali) and other additives. The solution is thoroughly mixed.

Bitumen emulsions used for dust prevention on roads can also be made from 130/200 and 200/300 bitumen. It is possible to achieve the result with slow thickening 70/130 bitumen. Dust prevention is performed with anionic emulsion diluted before use with water or emulsifier to obtain 30% bitumen

## What are Different Types of Bitumen Emulsion? – Asehbitumen
When applied to a surface bitumen emulsion must break and set. Technically breaking means the evaporation of water which makes bitumen strong enough for sticking to aggregates and setting on the place of appliion. The time that is needed for bitumen emulsion to lose water and behave like an ordinary bitumen is called the reactivity rate.

## Bitumen emulsion for soil stabilization 
Bitumen Emulsions can be used for stabilising both cohesive as well as non-cohesive soils. However in soils with finer grain sizes this method may no longer be cost effective as the soil particles require a high dosage of bitumen emulsion in order to provide the same/better level of bonding.

The UVB-2 unit by GlobeCore offers 6 – 22 m3/hour production capacity. Bitumen modifiion occurs in a colloid mill which performs preliminary mixing of bitumen and polymer as well as mixture homogenization. One more function of the colloid mill as part of this equipment is grinding of components.
