The uranium fuel cycle includes all the steps of using uranium to generate electricity (fission) from mining to disposal/storage. These steps are described below. Uranium Recovery. Uranium ore is mined--much like coal--from underground mines or surface mines.In the USA a short ton of uranium ore usually contains about 3 to 10 pounds of uranium.

## What is High
 · Irradiated fuels are dissolved in hydrochloric acid gas to remove the aluminum or zirconium cladding. The fuel is then passed through a modular solvent extraction system to separate the uranium from its fission products. The uranium is then downblended with lower enriched uranium and returned to its solid form to produce HALEU.

## Is nuclear power the answer to climate change? 
Known global uranium resources could supply no more than the equivalent of 3.5 years of present day total world energy consumption and expected not proven resources could extend this supply by only another 25 years. A 70 % contribution from nuclear power would mean that all uranium supplies would come to an end by 2011.
