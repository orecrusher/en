Abstract Two different experimental approaches were realized for investigations of integral characteristics of single droplet ignition of coal-water slurry containing petrochemicals (CWSP) inside the hot flow of the gas oxidant. At first the droplet was fixed inside the flow by special holder and the second way is free injection of the soaring droplet into the volume of combustion chamber.
