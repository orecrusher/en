The rate of flow on a filter depends on the type of filter. A rapid sand filter will have a flow of 2-3 gpm/square foot of filter area. The high rate filter may have 4-6 gpm/square foot applied to the surface. A constant rate flow valve is almost fully closed when a filter is clean so that the desired water level on top of the filter is maintained.
