## Crush washers.. Al vs Cu 
 · They definitely 'crush' or deform. A regular washer is typically made of steel and is much harder. I think you'd have a hard time crushing a steel washer in between a drain plug and a stamped metal oil pan without doing more damage to the oil pan. An aluminum crush washer deforms slightly under normal drain plug torque (below 30 ft/lbs).
