## Natural gas power plant 
Natural gas power plants generate electricity by burning natural gas as their fuel.There are many types of natural gas power plants which all generate electricity but serve different purposes. All natural gas plants use a gas turbine; natural gas is added along with a stream of air which combusts and expands through this turbine causing a generator to spin a magnet making electricity.

 · If the mill is self-sufficient in steam from the recovery boiler and while firing only wood waste in the power boiler then the steam saved can be used to produce additional power. Product liquor solids and high solids firing Most North American pulp mills fire liquor in the recovery boiler at dry solids level in the range of 68 to 75%.

## What are Turbines ? 
Turbines used in thermal powerplants :-Also called as steam turbines they are used in nuclear thermal powerplants where water is heated to form steam then flowed through turbines to produce electricity. Alike water turbines steam turbines are also classified into impulse reaction types but the arrangement design is different.
