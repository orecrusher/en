## Rare
 · Rare-earth element - Rare-earth element - Processing ores: All rare-earth ores contain less than 10 percent REO and must be upgraded to about 60 percent in order to be processed further. They are first ground to a powder and then separated from the other materials in the ore body by various standard processes that include magnetic and/or electrostatic separation and flotation.

## Defining Minerals 
Naturally formed: Minerals form through natural processes including volcanic eruptions precipitation of a solid out of a liquid and weathering of pre-existing minerals. Today scientists engineers and manufacturers synthesize many ceramics plastics and other substances with a specific chemical composition and structure but none of these synthetic substances is considered a true mineral.

## Rocks and minerals 
Rocks are generally made up of two of more minerals mixed up through geological processes. For example granite is an igneous rock mostly made from different proportions of the minerals quartz feldspar and mica as interlocked crystals; a sandstone is a sedimentary rock that can also contain quartz feldspar and mica but as grains compacted and cemented into each other.

Mineral processing art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock or gangue. It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.

## What are the Endogenous and Exogenous Processes of the Earth?
Endogenous processesAlso known as hypogenic processes they are processes of internal origin. In other words they are processes that originate within the Earth crust And are therefore called endogenous. These processes take place within the planet and are governed by forces inherent to the Earth and little affected by external influences.

 · Understand the different geologic processes involved in rock formation. Just a fun fact approximately 85% of the Earth's crust is composed of oxygen and silicon. Together they form the silicon oxygen tetrahedron which is the basic building block of silie minerals. Silies are also termed as (common) rock forming minerals.
