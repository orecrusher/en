## Gravity separation 
Gravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components either a suspension or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical: i.e. the components of the mixture have different specific weight. All of the gravitational methods are common in the sense that they all use gravity as the dominant force.

Gold is one of the heaviest minerals. When pure it has a specific gravity of 19.3. Due to its weight it can be panned because the Gold sinks to the bottom. In addition it can be easily separated from other substances due to the weight differences. Gold is also the most malleable and ductile substance known.

## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

## Gold Cyanidation 
Process. Cyanide can be used to extract gold either in a controlled mill environment or more crudely on rock piles in the open. Cyanide "vat leaching" mixes finely crushed ore with a cyanide salt in water. The cyanide binds to the gold ions and makes them soluble in water thereby allowing separation from the rock.
