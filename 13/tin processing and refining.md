 · Tin is typically extracted from a mineral called cassiterite a compound of tin and oxygen. Tin's basic refining process makes it appealing for manufacturing. Tin also does not corrode easily which is why it is useful for cans. A modern tin can is actually made from steel coated with a very thin layer of tin to prevent the steel from corroding.
