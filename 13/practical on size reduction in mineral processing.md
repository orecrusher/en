processing. Some remain in various mineral sands circuits but RER separators are rapidly replacing them. The RER allows mineral processors to get over 50% greater capacity per unit operation over IRM separators. This allows for smaller footprints without compromising performance which equates to substantially reduced costs per ton treated.

## A Process for Reducing Rocks and Concentrating Heavy Minerals
To obtain minerals suitable for age-dating and other analyses it is necessary to first reduce the mineral-bearing rock to a fine sand-like consistency. Reducing whole rock requires crushing grinding and sieving. Ideally the reduced material should range in size from 80- to 270-mesh (an opening between wires in a sieve).

Blasting provides the first opportunity for comminution – or size reduction. It is also a cheaper and more efficient process compared to both crushing and grinding. One of the most valuable aspects of blasting is the generation of very fine particles (e.g. smaller than 12mm) that will pass through the primary mills and onto the secondary ball mill circuits alleviating a common bottleneck.

## Particle size distribution 
 · Particle Size Distribution Process of Sieving The process of sieving may be divided into two stages. First the elimination of particles considerably smaller than the screen apertures which should occur fairly rapidly and second the separation of the so-called "near-size" particles which is a gradual process rarely reaching final completion. The effectiveness of a sieving test depends on
