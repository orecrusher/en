## Solution
Bias factor. You can use the bias factor definition in the remeshing rule to further tune the distribution of sizing between maximum and minimum base solution loions. The bias factor defines the gradient of the size distribution between these two extremes in your remesh region as shown in Figure 3.

## Adjusting for Confounding in the Analysis
 · Adjusting for Confounding in the Analysis. Confounding is a type of bias because it causes biased estimates of associations. However confounding is different from selection bias and information bias because it is caused by an imbalance in other risk factors and the investigators can adjust for confounding in the analysis phase in order to minimize its effects.

The belt tensioner has no automatic spring. Check the tension by twisting the belt with your thumb and forefinger midway along the longest straight run between the two main sprockets. If the belt tension is correct you should just be able to twist it through 90 degrees. If you can twist it more or less than this the tension needs to be adjusted.
