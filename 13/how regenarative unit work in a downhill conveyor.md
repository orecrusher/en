## regenerative braking for conveyors
how regenarative unit work in a downhill conveyor. For downhill conveyors continuous regenerative braking operation is typically required. Here an Active Front End (AFE) drive or alternatively a regenerative drive panel solution using a standard 6-pulse drive with separate regenerative module is the best solution to feed back energy when the conveyor runs downhill.

## Braking and Regeneration 
This will occur if the load is giving up energy such as when a crane or elevator is lowering a load or maybe when a conveyer is transporting material downhill. Regeneration as it is called will also take place if a high inertia load is decelerated; in this case the energy stored in the rotating mass flows back through the motor to the drive.

## Regenerative Braking 
Regenerative braking is unique to EVs and enables the vehicle's kinetic energy to be converted back to electrical energy during braking (deceleration or downhill running). The converted electrical energy is stored in energy storage devices such as batteries ultracapacitors and ultrahigh-speed flywheels to extend the driving range by up to 10%.

## FAQ: What are regenerative drives and where are they used?
 · Regenerative appliions. Appliions that involve frequent starts and stops constant deceleration or overhauling loads are good candidates for the use of regenerative drives. Examples include downhill conveyors (constant deceleration) elevators and flywheels.

## Drives for conveyors in mining 
For downhill conveyors continuous regenerative braking operation is typically required. Here an Active Front End (AFE) drive or alternatively a regenerative drive panel solution using a standard 6-pulse drive with separate regenerative module is the best solution to feed back energy when the conveyor runs downhill.

## Regenerative Belt Conveyor versus Haul Truck
Generally the conception of a regenerative conveyor is based on regenerative or continuous braking needed while conveyors are running downhill. Energy generated during the braking process is fed back to electrical network when using an AC drive or to other driving motors while connecting their AC drive and DC busbars together [ 34 ].

Generally belt conveyors only require braking when it takes too long for the system to come to rest (i.e. during a power failure or to prevent "roll-back" of the load when the conveyor is inclined/ declined). In the case of an inclined conveyor it's normal to use a backstop. But for a downhill or overland conveyor regenerative
