 · Rock Contact Zones and Faults: Many quartz veins and other hard rock gold deposits occur in "zones" along faults or at the contact of two different types of rock. Correct Topography: As a general concept the coarser gold does tend to hang up farther upstream.

Gold doré bars commonly come from two sources; mines or reclamation scrap. Mines almost never excavate pure gold ore. Most ores contain a mixture of gold and other useful base and/or precious metals. Silver for example is one of the precious metals most often found with gold ore so a doré bar will often be made primarily from these two metals.

## An ore is a rock that contains which of the following? A 
An ore is defined as a rock or sediment found in nature which contains a mineral or metal with economic usefulness. The minerals or metals in the ore must be extracted before they could be used and typically they are refined via smelting. The ore grade is defined according to the concentration of the mineral or metal beneath the rock or sediment.
