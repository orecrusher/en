 · The stages might run: coarse grind pre-concentration flotation grind rougher flotation regrind and cleaning flotation. Gorain agrees that it could potentially be of use. "Non-flotation-based pre-concentration is actually much more attractive because you're trying to deal with the waste right in the mining before any major energy intensive comminution is pursued" he said.

 · The Froth Flotation Process is about taking advantage of the natural hydrophobicity of liberated (well ground) minerals/metals and making/playing on making them hydrophobic (water-repel) individually to carefully separate them from one another and the slurry they are in. For this purpose we use chemicals/reagents: Frothers (MIBC) is what allows the formation of air bubbles.
