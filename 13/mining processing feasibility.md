Determining the feasibility of a mineral property may besimple or sophistied but has one primary goal. This is todemonstrate that the project is economically viable if it isdesigned constructed and operated appropriately. Thefeasibility study will define the ore reserves the miningmethods the mineral processing concepts and the scale ofthe project.

## Why feasibility studies fail – AMC Consultants
These ranges are wider than generally understood but are constrained by what is practical. For example many people expect a feasibility study accuracy to be +/- 10% but this is rarely achievable other than within the constrained boundary of the processing plant. Estimates for mining and infrastructure are much less reliable.
