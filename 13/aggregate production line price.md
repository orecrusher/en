 · The 45-degree line of economics is so named because it forms a 45-degree angle with both the x and y axes when charted. In Keynesian economics this line illustrates all of the points at which aggregate expenditures measured on the y or vertical axis are equal to aggregate production which are measured on the x or horizontal axis.

## The Expenditure
 · The point where the aggregate expenditure line that is constructed from C + I + G + X – M crosses the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium for the economy. It is the only point on the aggregate expenditure line where the total amount being spent on aggregate demand equals the total level of production.
