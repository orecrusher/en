## Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and Process and Instrument 
Process flow diagrams (PFDs) are used in chemical and process engineering. These diagrams show the flow of chemicals and the equipment involved in the process. Generally a Process Flow Diagram shows only the major equipment and doesn't show details. PFDs are used for visitor information and new employee training.

## Beneficiation 
Mineral beneficiation is a process that seeks to improve the quality and value of ore by cleaning and purifying it. Impurities and other contents are separated to achieve a higher purity of the ore or coal and prepares it for further processing. Our mining services in the area of beneficiation include mineral processing and coal upgrading.
