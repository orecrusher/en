## Vibrating screens 
Vibrating screen equipment in mineral processing has a tough job. The eccentric motion with high vibration coupled with heavy loads puts a strain on components and especially bearings that are exposed to the elements and abrasive dust. It's an environment where equipment failure is often accepted as a cost of doing business.

## What Is Vibrating Screen Mesh
The quarry vibrating screen is mainly used to screen gravel and the quality of the screen mesh determines the material screening efficiency. Therefore quarry investors or equipment purchasers will ask the manufacturer for information about vibrating screen media types when choosing a vibrating screen.

## Vibrating Screen Working Principle
Also called simply screens a vibrating screen is formed by a vibrant chassis that supports in its interior one or several surfaces or elements of screening. The screens serve to classify the different particles by size starting from a bulk product in a continuous process. The inlet material (the raw product) advances from the part where the screen is fed to the opposite end in which the particles come out separately according to their size
