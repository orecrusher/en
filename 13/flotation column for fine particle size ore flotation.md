 · The effect of particle size on the flotation of coarse particles is analyzed. It is concluded that turbulence and the presence of the froth layer are detrimental to the recovery of coarse particles during conventional flotation. A counter-current column cell is proposed to avoid these two factors. In this column a net upwards flow of water is prevalent such that no froth is allowed to form

## Modelling of negative bias column for coarse particles 
Abstract A model for coarse particle flotation in columns operating with negative bias is presented. The model assumes plug flow of particles and bubbles low turbulence and a collection mechanism based on bubble-particle interception. Experimental results obtained with quartz and calcite are in close agreement with the predicted values for particle sizes in the range 100 to 700 microns.
