## Best aluminum alloy for surface impact and wear?
 · Hard anodize is slick. If you are hard anodizing a surface that is a friction surface of the latch you may change how well the latch holds closed. I would think the change from a pot metal to a 2xxx or 7xxx aluminum would make the latch sufficiently stronger and more wear resistant.

## Development of a wear
Abstract A new method for a tool surface reinforcing coating was presented to prolong the tool life for hot stainless steel rolling above 1473 K. It is basically by welding a Co-based matrix powder mixed with an NbC powder on the surface of a medium-carbon steel using plasma transferred arc (PTA) welding technology. The new tool covers the region where the PTA welded tool for hot stainless

Electroplating. Chromium is electroplated onto various substrates in order to realize a more decorative and corrosion- or wear-resistant surface (24—32). About 80% of the chromium employed in metal treatment is used for chromium plating over 50% is for decorative chromium plating (see Metal surface treatments). Hard chromium plating differs from decorative plating mostiy in terms of thickness.

## What is Surface Hardness and Wear Resistance 
In general wear is mechanically induced surface damage that results in the progressive removal of material due to relative motion between that surface and a contacting substance or substances. A contacting substance may consist of another surface a fluid or hard abrasive particles contained in some form of fluid or suspension such as a lubricant for example.
