The faster the fine particles are screened out the more screen area is left for screening out critical incorrect size particles. For especially heavy and abrasive materials the upper tips of the crimped wire can wear out more quickly than the other parts of the wire mesh. This effect is eliminated by the EGLA mesh which is smooth on one side.
