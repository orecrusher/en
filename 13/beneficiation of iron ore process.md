## Beneficiation 
From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream (tailings). There are many different types of beneficiation with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.

## Why Should Iron Ore be Crushed First in Iron Ore Beneficiation
 · The crushing and grinding of iron ore is the process of reducing the particle size of the ore according to the requirements of the beneficiation operation. Reasons for Crushing Iron Ore Before Beneficiation. The useful minerals (minerals to be recovered) and gangue minerals (minerals to be discarded) in iron ore are closely interspersed together.

## What Is Iron Ore Beneficiation? (with pictures)
Iron ore beneficiation is a multi-stage process that raw iron ore undergoes to purify it prior to the process of smelting which involves melting the ore to remove the metal content. The process of iron ore beneficiation has two complementary goals and these define the methods used to refine it. The iron content of the ore needs to be increased and gangue which is native rock and minerals of lesser

## Beneficiation of iron ore 
The beneficiation of ore particularly iron ore conventionally has involved the use of various combinations of process setps such as crushing grinding or milling concentration or separation by size or weight such as by a screen and/or specific gravity as by a hydraulic classifier and concentration with the aid of flotation agents as in froth flotation or by means of a magnetic classifier.
