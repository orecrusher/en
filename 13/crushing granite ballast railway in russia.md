## Track ballast 
Track ballast forms the trackbed upon which railroad ties (sleepers) are laid. It is packed between below and around the ties. It is used to bear the load from the railroad ties to facilitate drainage of water and also to keep down vegetation that might interfere with the track structure. Ballast also holds the track in place as the trains roll over it.
