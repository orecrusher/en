The world will need iron ore for as long as the world needs steel. In 2020 we produced around 280 million tonnes of iron ore. That's enough to make the steel for more than 3300 Sydney Harbour Bridges. We're building a new iron ore mine in Western Australia. When completed South Flank will produce high-quality iron ore for around 25 years.
