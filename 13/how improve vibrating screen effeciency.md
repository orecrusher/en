## 10 top strategies on improving work efficiency 
What is work efficiency? Work efficiency is the ability to get the most output from the least possible input. It means doing more with less. Working smarter not harder. When you improve efficiency you're able to get a larger output from the same amount of input – or even less.For employees this means being able to get more done in a finite amount of time: the workday.
