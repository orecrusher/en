## Gold Refining Purify Process 
When I use this refining method I regard the purity of the gold as 22kt and I alloy it accordingly down to 18kt or 14kt. This gives me a safety margin so the gold is a slightly higher purity than I stamp it. Safety disclaimers notwithstanding this process uses nitric acid at 70% concentration and caution must be used.
