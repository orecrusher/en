## Linear Accelerator – Working Principle and Appliion
Linear Accelerator Construction And Working. A linear accelerator is a machine that can accelerate electrons close to the speed of light with an electromagnetic field. Electrons or protons with more than 18 MeV are bombarding to the target and higher kinetic energy is produced. In a tungsten target the particles produce the bremsstrahlung
