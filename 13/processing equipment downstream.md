## Downstream Bio
Downstream bio-processing is a process in biopharmaceutical manufacturing to recover the pure protein from contaminant proteins. The growth in this market is majorly driven by growing demand for biopharmaceuticals rising adoption of single-use technology (single use bio-processing equipment and consumables) and capacity expansion by biopharmaceutical manufacturers.
