If single samples are heated in a tube furnace with a flow of gas over the sample a plug of glass or quartz wool can be used to collect particulates or an absorption vessel can be used to collect volatile materials.

## An Introduction to Decalcifiion : Leica Biosystems
Because the process is very slow but very gentle (weeks may be required depending on the size of the specimen) this reagent is not suitable for urgent specimens but more appropriate for research appliions where very high quality morphology is required or particular molecular elements must be preserved for techniques such as IHC FISH or PCR. 9 It is used at a concentration of approximately

## Sampling Procedures 
 · 1. Introduction. The use of correct sampling and sample preparation practice is critical to the accurate delineation of ore resources as well as the evaluation and control of subsequent processing operations from mining through to delivery of the final product (François-Bongarçon and Gy 2002 Holmes 2002 Holmes 2004 Holmes 2010 Holmes 2013).

We refer to these types of convenience samples as "conventional" because they are by far the most common type of convenience sample in developmental science; however these types of convenience samples can also be conceptualized as heterogeneous convenience samples because by design the expectation is heterogeneity (i.e. diversity) in all sociodemographic factors As part of their tally

## merits of sample increment in mineral processing
Mineral processing mineral beneficiation or upgradation involves handling three primary types of ROM material which have been blasted fragmented and brought out from an in situ position. These materials can be used directly or by simple or complex processing and even by applying extractive metallurgy like hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical methods.
