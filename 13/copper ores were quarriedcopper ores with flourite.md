Vein deposits of this nature are a type of hydrothermal deposit because the mineral species which compose the veins were precipitated by hot waters. However sometimes the preexisting rock wall which contains the vein undergoes alteration. Portions of the host rock may either dissolve and be transported away or else react chemically with the circulating volatile fluids or the newly formed
