A process and system and for extracting and refining gold from ores using relatively benign and inexpensive chemicals fewer process steps and permitting the recycling and re-use of process chemicals. The invention is preferably implemented as a two part process. In a first part process gold is extracted from the ore and dissolved in a chemical solution to form a gold complex.
