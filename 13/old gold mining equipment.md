## Gold Rush Prospector Old Pictures: Miner 49er Panning Photos
Gold prospecting sure has changed over the last few hundred years. During the great gold rushes in the United States–which took place in the 1800's and early 1900's and were photographed extensively–miners and prospectors in search of gold traveled across the country to places like Georgia California Colorado Alaska and other states with hopes of striking it rich.

## Stamp mill 
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps loosely held vertically in a frame in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp the stamp falls onto the ore below crushing the rock and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.

## Restoring Historical Mining Equipment: (46) Operational 
There are two operational stamp mills that crush ore down to the consistency of sand and then passed on to shaker tables to extract the gold from the ore. The site was established in the 1990's and continues to operate. A lot of his equipment is "homemade" just like the old miners did it. He is definitely from the "old school" of mining.

## Mining Techniques of the Sierra Nevada and Gold Country
Gold panning techniques are centuries old but Isaac Humphrey is credited with introducing gold panning at Coloma in 1848. However the Mexicans may have beaten Humphrey to the punch as they also had developed the skills in their own country using a flat dish called a batea. Gold panning was slow even for the most skillful miner.
