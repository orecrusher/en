 · The milling depth is determined largely on the existing depth of the asphalt material. Only the asphalt layer is to be milled in this process. Milling depth can be done up to a depth of 5 inches however depths greater than 4 inches tend to present compaction problems when the improved material is re-placed onto the road surface with the paver.
