 · Three phase circuits can provide square root of 3 (1.732) times more power compared to single phase power with same current. Thus the three phase system saves electrical installation cost by reducing cable size and size of associated electrical devices. We can easily observe three phase circuits by looking at power line while travelling on roads.
