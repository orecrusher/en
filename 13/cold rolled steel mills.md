Cold rolled steel has a much smoother appearance and is stronger than hot rolled steel. It is the next step along the line of flat-rolled steel products. The process of creating cold rolled steel begins with hot rolled PO. The hot rolled PO is sent through a cold reduction process which creates a thinner thickness and a harder surface.

## Cold Rolled 
 · Cold Rolled Sheet Products are obtained in CSN from stripped hot rolled coils that have their thickness reduced in a cold strip rolling mill. The steel is severely work-hardened at this stage and recovers the ductility in subsequent annealing processes according to the requirements for mechanical properties and desired surface characteristics.

 · The cold rolling mill is usually fitted with thickness gauges that check the steel as it comes out of the rollers. Reversing mills are designed so that the steel can be reversed and pushed back through the rollers which are brought closer together each time until the desired thickness is achieved.

 · Cold rolled is the next step along the line of flat-rolled steel products. The process starts with hot rolled PO. Hot rolled is processed to a final thickness that is heavier than most sheet products. A cold-reducing process is used which results in a thinner thickness. The cold reduction starts with tension to the sheet.

## What is a Cold
 · Cold-rolled steel is produced in cold reduction mills where the material is cooled at near room temperature followed by annealing and/or tempers rolling. This process produces steel that has a wide range of surface finishes and is superior in tolerance concentricity and straightness compared to hot-rolled steel.
