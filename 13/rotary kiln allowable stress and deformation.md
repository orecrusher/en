Kiln plants with two and three station rotary kilns from KHD Humboldt Wedag are top of the line. One reason: highly efficient precalcining systems which were developed by KHD Humboldt Wedag revolutionizing the clinkering process. Rotary kilns no longer have to function as calciners which mean that they can be substantially smaller in size.

 · The rotary kiln was adopted by cement manufacturer in 1824 as soon as Joseph Aspdin () the brick-layer and mason in Leeds England discovered what he called Portland cement1. Although Portland cement had been gaining in popularity in Europe since 1850 it was not manufactured in the US until the 1870s.
