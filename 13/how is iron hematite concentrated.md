## How is hematite extracted? 
 · The blast furnace Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## How is iron extracted from haematite?
 · Iron is extracted from its ore haematite in a blast furnace. The ore is led into the top of the furnace along with coke and limestone. The limestone decomposes in the hot furnace forming calcium oxide. This reacts with the sandy impurities (silicon dioxide) to form a slag. Answer verified by Toppr.

 · Hematite. Hematite is possibly the most economically important iron mineral. It is an iron oxide with the chemical formula of Fe 2 O 3. It is variable in colour from black to deep red and is often the mineral that gives red-brown sandstone its colour. Pure hematite usually contains around 69.9% Fe.

## how is hematite iron processed 
How is hematite extracted? - findanyanswer. 28.04.2020 Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron (III) oxide Fe 2O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron (III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## Iron Ore Mining 
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
