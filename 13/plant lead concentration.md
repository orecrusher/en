## Lead (Pb) and water 
The same applies to lead compounds such as lead acetate lead oxide lead nitrate and lead carbonate. Lead limits plant chlorophyll synthesis. Nevertheless plants can take up high levels of lead up to 500 ppm from soils. Higher concentrations negatively influence plant growth. Through plant uptake lead enters food chains.

 · Tissue N concentration often decreases in plants grown at elevated [CO 2] (Drake et al. 1997; Curtis and Wang 1998). It is expected that respiration rate would be lower in tissues having lower [N] because the respiratory cost associated with protein turnover and maintenance is a large portion of dark respiration (Bouma et al. 1994).

## Lead Analysis of Soil Using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy 
Lead is also of concern in soil when it's used for gardening. Plants take up lead from the soil. Therefore vegetables or herbs grown in contaminated soil can lead to lead poisoning. In addition contaminated soil particles can be breathed in while gardening or brought into the house on clothing and footwear.

 · "Compost addition will dilute overall lead concentration in soil" says Hettiarachchi. In turn this reduces the amount of lead absorbed by the vegetables. Some substances in compost--notably phosphorus and iron oxides--"can help holding lead in soils and thereby reduce its availability to plants

Lead in the environment origins pathways and sinks. The natural concentration of lead in food resulting from the natural lead content of soil is a few tenths of a microgram per gram of wet plant material. 7. Present concentrations of lead in air do not measurably increase the lead content of the edible portion of most plants. 8. A several-fold

One reason is that salt causes a reduction in the rate and amount of water that the plant roots can take up from the soil (see Fig. 105). Also some salts are toxic to plants when present in high concentration. Fig. 105. A high salt concentration in the soil is harmful for the plants as the water uptake is reduced.
