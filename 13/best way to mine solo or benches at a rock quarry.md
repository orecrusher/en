## Reading: Open
Open-pit mining or open-cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth such as long wall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rocks are found near the surface; that is

## Surface Mining and Reclamation 
Good reclamation allows for proper future use and it limits environmental impacts. It is expected that surface miners do what's called 'segmental reclamation' where they restore portions of the mine while other areas continue to be worked. This helps reduce the cost of reclamation at the end of mining.
