## Gold extraction 
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution mineral processing hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.. Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing resulting in direct recovery of

## 5 Gold Extraction Methods to Improve Your Recovery Rate 
 · Placer gold ore with high gold content mostly exists in the form of particles. Therefore the ideal method to process placer gold ore is gravity separation. Rock gold ores have a more complex composition than placer gold ores' thus whether to choose gravity separation and flotation separation depends on the specific composition.

 · Gold in refractory sulfide ores occurs as fine inclusions or in solid solution typically within pyrite marcasite and arsenopyrite grains. In this type of ore because the gold is encapsulated the interaction with cyanide to form the soluble metal complex is inhibited (Marsden and House 2006 La Brooy et al. 1994).
