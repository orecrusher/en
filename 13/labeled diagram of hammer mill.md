## Hammermills versus roller mills 
By using a roller mill or adopting roller grinding principles as part of the feed mechanism on entry to the hammermill the raw material is partially ground at that point which then allows the hammers and screens in the grinding chamber of the hammermill to be fully effective with often excellent grinding efficiency results.
