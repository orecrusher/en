## What is Beneficiation? 
The goal of beneficiation is to eliminate inefficiency and waste by ensuring that as much recoverable material as possible is extracted from ore. A number of techniques can be used for this often starting with grinding the ore into particles. Once ground the particles can be sifted and sorted to extract usable material and set waste aside.
