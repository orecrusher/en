## Iron Ore Smelting Process 
 · At the surface iron ore processing plants the iron ore is put through crushers and ball mills to break it into a uniform and more workable size and then washed with the residue going to tailings. The ore is the transported to the various smelters loed locally or on the other side of the world with large bulk carriers being used to ship the ore by sea.

A few early smelt mills are recorded elsewhere but none are known in the area being studied until the late sixteenth century when mills were built at Marrick and Clints in Marske.

## Smelting 
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores including silver iron copper and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

WEALDEN IRON - A BRIEF HISTORY Early iron smelting The Weald's iron deposits lie relatively close to the ground surface and so were easily extracted by open cast mining. Most extraction and smelting took place in the High Weald a section stretching roughly east of Horsham across to south of Tunbridge Wells and down to Hastings.
