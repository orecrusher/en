## Cyclone separator 
In the dairy industry cyclone separators are used for gas-solid and gas-liquid separations. The key example of cyclone separation of gas-solid mixtures is the separation of powder particles from the outlet air from spray dryers and fluidized bed dryers both to increase yield and to minimize air pollution.

Choke Valve. Choke valve sometimes also known as 'choker valve' is a type of control valve mostly used in oil and gas production wells to control the flow of well fluids being produced. Another purpose that the choke valves serve is to kill the pressure from reservoir and to regulate the downstream pressure in the flowlines.

The content of the cyclone must be emptied regularly so the vortex of the air inside it isn't impeded. This is achieved with a rotary airlock valve.

The simplest separator is the gravity separator. The rule of thumb used to size a gravity separator is that the superficial velocity of vapor at the free surface should be less than 0.3 m/s. When the velocity is greater than this the carryover increases rapidly. Kataoka et al. (1981) describe the carryover process in

 · A butterfly valve is a rotary valve that uses a disc as the closure member. The disc shaped closure member is rotated through 90 0 or there about to open or close the passage. The disc closes against a ring seal to close off the flow. The other main parts are the valve body the stem/ shaft and the valve actuator.
