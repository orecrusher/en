## Understanding How Granite Slabs Are Made 
After granite has first been mined out of the earth it will be in a very rough form. After the mining process is complete the granite will be sent to a workshop to be transformed into slabs. A technician will use milling machines to cut and polish the granite. Once milling has been completed the slab will be between 7 and 9 feet long.
