Screw conveyor segments Screw conveyor segments are manufactured to your specifiions. They are available with an outer diameter between 30 mm and 3.000 mm; the material thickness is between 2 and 40 mm. Any desired pitch is possible. Below please find an example of a screw conveyor segment with a right and a left pitch.

A screw conveyor consists of a circular or U-shaped tube which a helix rotates. Grain is pushed along the bottom of the tube by the helix; thus the tube does not fill completely. Screw conveyors are widely used for transporting and/or elevating particulates at controlled and steady rates. They are used in many bulk materials handling
