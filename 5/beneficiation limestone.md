Abstract Pilot scale column flotation studies were conducted on a low grade siliceous limestone ore. Silica content was reduced to less than 1% in the concentrate so that it became satisfactory for use in the paper or rubber industries. The limestone sample was crystalline and constituted primarily of calcite that contained quartz feldspar pyroxene and biotite as gangue minerals.
