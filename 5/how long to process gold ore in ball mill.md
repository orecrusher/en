## Extracting Gold 
To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

The development of cyanide milling at the end of the nineteenth century required grinding into smaller and more uniform sized particles using Chilean mills ball mills and tube mills. After crushing or grinding miners often used vibrating or shaking machines called concentrators (e.g. jigs buddles vanners Embrey tables and tables) to separate heavier metal-bearing ores from gangue.

## Heap Leaching of Gold and Silver Ores 
 · Gold recovery efficiency from operating heap leaches is typically ∼70% although it can range from 50% to 90%. Silver recovery efficiency is typically ∼55%. Most gold heap leaches apply cyanide within a range of 200–600 mg/L NaCN. Silver-bearing ores should usually be leached with a cyanide level of 600–1000 mg/L NaCN.

fed in ratio to the ore feed mass. The rod mill discharge is pumped without any further water addition to the first ball mill. The ball mill discharges to a sump where water is added before the slurry is pumped to the first cyclone (Cylcone 1). See Figure 1 for a schematic of the process flow. The slurry stream is classified at Cyclone 1

## How Is Gold Purified? 
 · If the gold is a low grade ore then it is broken up into chunks that are then put in carefully lined pads and treated with a dilute cyanide solution which dissolves the gold. For high grade ore the metal is sent to a grinding mill and made into a powder. Refractory ore contains carbon and is heated to over 1000 degrees F which removes

Since 31 December 2019 the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves were depleted by 0.2 million ounces of gold and 0.01 million tonnes of copper. Mining of Ore Reserves in the Main Dome open pit was completed in the fourth quarter of FY20. Further studies are currently evaluating potential for additional Ore Reserves in Main Dome open pit.

## Using Ball Mills to Extract Raw Gold from Ores 
 · Metallurgical processing of metalliferous ores in general and gold ores in particular consists essentially of three stages often colloquially referred to as: Bashing (crushing); Mashing (grinding); and. Hashing (extraction/recovery) In the context of flowsheet selection the bashing and mashing stages are relatively straightforward.
