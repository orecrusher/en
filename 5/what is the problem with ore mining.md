## Mine Waste Transfer and Disposal Methods 
Typically for every ton of ore that is mined 5 tons of overburden is displaced. Overburden is not subjected to any chemical processes but must be removed to access the ore underneath. Overburden is managed by using it to resurface previously mined areas to revegetate and restore them to their original appearance prior to being mined.

## Mining Problems and Possible Solutions 
 · The overburden from an open pit mine (the world's preferred mining method) sometimes reaches five times the mass of minerals removed for processing. Overburden is piled near the mine and can become unstable and dangerous. Some overburden mountains are as high as 200m and can be poisonous to ground water and animal life.

 · With most of the easily-accessible high grade ores almost tapped out companies are faced with the challenge of either mining low grade ore bodies or mining in difficult or remote regions. In the case of low grade ore bodies it is very important to remove as much of the desired ore from the mined material as possible in order for the mining operation to remain economically feasible.
