If the ore product contains a combination of coarse and fine free gold the modular Gravity Flotation Intensive Leach (GFIL) system can produce a higher-yield product. For ores smaller than 50 micron the particle weight is too light for physical separation by gravity; therefore gold recovery will require a modular chemical flotation process.

## Mineral Flotation 
Abstract. In the extraction of metals from their ores the process of mineral flotation plays a most important role. Flotation provides the means of separating and concentrating the valuable components of an ore to produce a grade of mineral concentrate suitable for feeding to efficient pyrometallurgical or hydro-metallurgical operations.

To meet these needs custom-formulated reagents which improve flotation kinetics while delivering optimum grade and recovery are a must."

In a typical pyrytic gold ore the gold is encapsulated within an iron sulfide crystal structure. Highly oxidized ores generally do not respond well to flotation. Advantages of the flotation process are that gold values are generally liberated at a fairly coarse particle size (28 mesh) which means that ore grinding costs are minimized.

Flotation is usually used by large scale miners but can also be applied in small scale operations. It is a process that works best for processing complex ore types especially ores that are difficult to process using gravity methods. In flotation a mixture of slurry (crushed ore and water) and frothing agents are added into a flotation machine.
