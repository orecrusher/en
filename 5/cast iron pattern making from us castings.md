## Casting Patterns and Patternmaking 
 · Casting is the process of pouring liquid metal into a mold where it cools and solidifies. The casting process can produce everything from art pieces to engine parts. The shape is determined by the mold cavity but something needs to shape the mold—that's where the pattern comes in. Patterns are a model for the object to be cast.

The Shrinkage allowance is usually taken as 1 percent for cast iron 2 percent for steel 1.5 percent for aluminum 1.5 percent for magnesium 1.6 percent for brass and 2 percent for bronze. In order to eliminate the need for recalculating all the dimensions of a casting. Pattern makers use a shrink rule or Contraction scale.

## Pattern Allowances for Proper Casting of Metals 
If the actual object itself is used for the pattern the resulting casting would be slightly smaller than desired. To compensate for this possibility a shrink rule is used in laying out of measurements for the pattern. A shrink rule for cast iron is 10 mm per metre (the average shrinkage for cast iron) longer than the standard rule.
