## Effective harvesting of low surface
Microalgae harvesting by air flotation is a promising technology for large-scale production of biofuel feed and nutraceuticals from algae. With an adherence-to-hydrocarbon method and two different types of flotation cells (mechanically agitated cell and Jameson cell) microalgal surface hydrophobicity and bubble size were identified to be critical for effective froth flotation of microalgae.
