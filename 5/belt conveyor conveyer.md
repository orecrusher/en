The ocean is not a still body of water. There is constant motion in the ocean in the form of a global ocean conveyor belt.

## Belt Conveyor Manufacturer 
Belt conveyors are the most economical method of transporting bulk materials over both short and long distances. Belt conveyors are ideal for conveying bulk materials of large lump size since the bulk materials stay stationary on the belt. The layout of your plant can be simplified and made more efficient with the use of belt conveyors.

The total belt elongation consists of an elastic (which recovers) and a plastic (which remains) portion. As per ISO 9856 a belt sample is subjected to a sinusoidal cyclic stress that varies from 2 to 10 % of the belt's nominal breaking strength. 2 - 10 % because this is a typical operating range for textile conveyor belts.
