Flotation separation and recovery of lead and zinc concentrates from ores containing galena (PbS) and sphalerite (ZnS) is well established and generally achieved quite effectively. Silver often provides highly significant economic value if not the greatest value with the silver most often associated with the galena mineralization which is fortuitous since smelters pay more for silver in lead

Lead-Bismuth Flotation. Often we hear that copper concentrates have contaminants which affect the incomes to be obtained by commercialization. Well one of the worst contaminant is bismuth because is difficult to remove during smelting process and the metallic copper to be obtained at the end of the process will be brittle and consequently its mechanical properties will be very bad.
