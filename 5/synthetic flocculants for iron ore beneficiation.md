## Depressants and Flocculants in Iron Ore Beneficiation 
 · The ionic flotation of silica from iron ores has received particular attention at the Mines Experiment Station for two purposes: (1) reduction of the silica content of magnetite-taconite concentrates from 8 or 8.5 percent to about 5 percent and (2) upgrading of the combined concentrates from low- intermediate- and high-intensity magnetic separators for the treatment of oxidized taconites

water/slurry is also an essential step in the iron ore washing. In an iron ore washing plant huge amount of water is required further there is loss of water and fresh water typically ~15 % is added to maintain the total amount of water in the washing circuit. Different kinds of flocculants are used for this purpose.
