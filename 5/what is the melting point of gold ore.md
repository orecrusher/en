## Using Borax Flux to Refine Gold 
 · With some borax heat and a little know-how it's possible to extract pure gold from a sample of ore. This is because using borax as the flux reduces the melting point of all the elements in a piece of ore including gold. While out in the field a gold prospector can grind and wash a piece of ore then mix it with borax in a plastic bag.

The more pure the gold the more valuable it is. The process of smelting is how gold is separated from impurities with the end result being solid gold. It is possible to melt your own gold with the proper equipment. If doing small amounts like melting down broken jewelry it is possible to even use a 1200 watt microwave to do the job.

Its melting point is 1945° F. Gold is not corroded or tarnished by moisture or oxidized (rust) by the effects of oxygen and water or affected by ordinary acids as most other metals are. Deposits of gold that have lain inside a mountain or under a streambed or even on the ocean's bottom will remain there and be rather unaffected until moved by the natural forces of the earth-or taken by man.

Gold doré bars commonly come from two sources; mines or reclamation scrap. Mines almost never excavate pure gold ore. Most ores contain a mixture of gold and other useful base and/or precious metals. Silver for example is one of the precious metals most often found with gold ore so a doré bar will often be made primarily from these two metals.

The short answer assumes you are melting pure gold but if other other alloy metals lare present (copper is the most commonly used base metal) then the temperature required to melt gold will vary.

## Gold 
 · The ore containing gold once mined from the earth is processed by separating gold minerals from the crude matter holding the ore together. The gold ore is then pulverized using pressure to create very fine particles. These fine particles are then heated in a furnace to temperatures above 1064 degrees Celsius the melting point of gold.
