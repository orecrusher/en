The old-timers used very ineffective methods but a lot of gold was taken out of the streams and banks. That gold had been setting there for hundreds if not thousands of years. It takes time for the waterways and banks to "replenish" the gold that is recovered by miners. Mother Nature helps every year through floods and snowmelt.

## Using Ball Mills to Extract Raw Gold from Ores 
Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills they must be operated in a closed system with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced. Various classifiers such as screens spiral
