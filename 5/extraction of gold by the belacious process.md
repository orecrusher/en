## Extraction Of Gold By The Belacious Process
Gold cyanidation is the main process of gold extraction. There are two commonly used gold cyanidation processes: one is the use of activated carbon to adsorb and recover gold from cyanide pulp also known as the all-slime zinc cyanide replacement method; the other One is to replace the gold with zinc powder after washing in the thickener also known as the all-slime cyanide carbon slurry
