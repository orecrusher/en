## Placer Dome Gold Mine 
 · Run-of-mine ore is crushed and ground free gold is recovered in a gravity circuit and flotation is used to recover a sulphide concentrate. This is then oxidised using autoclaves producing feed for conventional carbon-in-pulp cyanide leaching to recover the contained gold. Low-grade stockpile and open pit ore are crushed using a gyratory crusher.
