## Sustainability in Ironmaking: The Rise of Direct Reduction 
Modern-day direct reduction of iron first developed as a small-scale low capital and operating cost alternative to the blast furnace. Since commercialization of continuous DR technology in the late 1960s the market for the products of direct reduction has grown to more than 74 million tonnes in 2012.

Direct reduced iron (DRI) also called sponge iron is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps pellets or fines) to iron by a reducing gas or carbon produced from natural gas or coal. Its main use is as raw material feedstock for electric furnaces in mini mills where DRI can be used as a scrap substitute.

## Direct Reduction Plant Products 
Direct Reduction is an iron making process for the new era which utilizes natural gas to reduce iron ore to produce Direct Reduced Iron (DRI). As Direct Reduction Plants are not built on the same enormous scale as Blast Furnaces their investment costs are lower and they have been mainly constructed in developing countries where natural gas is relatively inexpensive.

## Direct Reduced Iron 
Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) also known as Sponge Iron offers an alternative steel production route to BF-BOF and Scrap-EAF routes. In DRI iron ore is reduced in its solid state – unlike BF process where a liquid metal is formed during reduction. DRI can then be transformed to steel in electric arc furnaces. DRI production is common in Middle East South America India and Mexico.

## Direct
All effective methods of direct reduction actually use the same process: rich iron ore (fine concentrate or pellets) is reduced by a special gas mixture up to the iron content of 85-90%. This explains why the production of direct-reduced iron is mainly concentrated in countries with large reserves of oil (oilwell gas) natural gas and iron ore as well as limited scrap resources.

## MIT STEEL – Your Trusted Partner
Direct reduced iron (DRI) also called sponge iron is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps pellets or fines) to iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal. Many ores are suitable for direct reduction.

## The HBI direct reduction process 
 · The direct reduction process. HBI is the product of reducing iron ore with natural gas. This is called the direct reduction process and is an environmentally-friendly production process; a DRI plant uses natural gas which is more environmentally sound than coke. The reduction process takes place in the reduction tower.

 · Direct material cost per unit = ($ 500 + $ 150 + $ 50 + $ 20)/100 = $ 7.2 per LED. Direct labor cost per unit = $ 100/100 = $ 1 per LED. Manufacturing overhead = $ 1000/100 = $ 10 per LED. So the total production cost comes to $ 18.20 per LED light. Example 2: Michael started a new business of manufacuring Furnitures.
