## Beneficiation of manganese ores with particular reference 
Most manganese ores due to their complex mineral association and their variable physical characteristics present many beneficiation problems some of which cannot be overcome satisfactorily. The manganese deposits of Fiji are becoming increasingly important but before many of them can be exploited a cheap beneficiation process will be required.

 · Manganese is considered a relatively rare metal as concentrations of it in ore of commercial importance are geographically limited. In nature manganese is found in the form of oxides carbonates and silies. Manganese ores are complex in the sense that they not only consist of a complex oxide mineral assemblage but these minerals are also very finely inter-grown. South Africa

 · This can be explained by poor crystallinity of some phases and insufficient holding time in air to reach equilibrium as can also be expected during the industrial processing of manganese ores. In the original ore manganese naturally existed in the oxidising Mn 4+ state in the form of pyrolusite nsutite bixbyite or braunite.

Pure Manganese used for the production of iron-free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process. The treatment of the Manganese ore should be designed to produce a maximum amount of the Manganese in a coarse form which will be marketable without the further and high cost of nodulizing or sintering.

## Production of Ferro
 · Ferro-manganese (Fe-Mn) is an important additive used as a deoxidizer in the production of steel. It is a master alloy of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) with a minimum Mn content of 65 % and maximum Mn content of 95 %. It is produced by heating a mixture of the oxides of Mn (MnO2) and iron (Fe2O3) with carbon (C) normally as coke or coal.
