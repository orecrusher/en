## A Poor Man's Method of Smelting Gold 
 · Smelting gold usually involves high-tech and high-cost tools to perform. Mostly mining companies do the procedure which sees one material bonded to or released from another in the presence of extreme heat. However prospectors and people at home can smelt their old gold using some simple steps.

 · Many use flotation to recover sulfides. I doubt there is a single one that uses floatation to recover free gold as their normal ore processing method. Many tests have been done and yes gold can be floated under certain special conditions but there are loads of difficulties that render it impractical on a production basis. I will do up

## How to refine gold 
The resulting product is a muddy substance that is almost pure gold (99.999% or 24K). This muddy substance is dried until it is a powdered residue and then heated with a torch or other source of heat to melt the gold powder into useable gold. The acids used for this process are Nitric acid and Hydrochloric acid. Read more common gold questions.

## Gold Extraction Recovery Processes
 · Flotation is one of the most important gold recovery processes and its main restriction is to recover coarse gold particles ranging from 400 to 250 µm. This process recovers fine particles of free gold gold associated in any form with sulphides and native gold present in polymetallic deposits with certain degree of oxidation.

 · The gold floats because of the surface tension of the water. In a small recirculating operation you can use a Jet Dry or dish soap to break the surface tension and the gold will not float anymore. With a dredge as long as you don't bring the gold to the surface it shouldn't float. Maybe a deflector to keep it down in the sluice might help. Good
