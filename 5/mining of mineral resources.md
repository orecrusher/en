 · The British Geological Survey (BGS) has published statistics on the world mining industry since 1913. The most recent edition of its World Mineral Production document reports that in 2016 production of some of the most vital minerals stalled while production of other resources fluctuated. Here are the five most-mined minerals in the world.

## All About Mining 
Mining has been a part of the Earth's history since prehistoric times. Mining has played a role throughout the millennia - from Neanderthals' use of stone to ancient Egyptians' Greeks' Romans' and Incans' more sophistied mining processes and uses of mined materials. From the Industrial Age and the ability of mass production societies' progress has led to our Modern times

 · Regulatory constraints also mean that estimated resources and reserves seldom capture the full extent of a mineral deposit. Similarly co- and by-product metals and minerals that are commonly produced by mines may not be captured by resource and reserve estimates because of their limited economic contribution.

## What Mineral Resources Exist in Space? (with pictures)
Asteroids contain valuable minerals. The concept of exploiting asteroids for minerals has been called asteroid mining. Sufficient resources exist in the asteroid belt to sustain the iron and nickel needs of our civilization for many years to come but the high costs of space launches make their current recovery prohibitively expensive.
