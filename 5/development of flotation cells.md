Fetal cell line: The HEK293 cell line originated from a healthy aborted child in the 1970s age unknown. Did Pfizer/BioNTech use the HEK293 fetal cell line in research? Yes they did in the research and development of the vaccine similar to the way Moderna (above) did. They used the HEK293 cell line for testing the vaccine.

## Development of the Hydrojet Flotation Cell
The prototype flotation cell named HYDROJET is set up in a continuous-operation laboratory plant installed at the DIGITA Laboratories of the University of Cagliari. In the past a number of tests have been carried out with this prototype on coal industrial minerals and sulphide ores taking into account various operational variables.

The scaling-up of the large flotation cells that have been developed during the past few years has been based on hydrodynamic considerations and has resulted in a 500 ft3 cell unit. Plant results on a porphyry copper ore show that the 500 ft3 unit is equivalent to the previously used 300 ft3 model.
