## What Is Durability Of Concrete? Factors Affecting It?
The durability of concrete will be affected by the shrinkage of concrete. If the cement content is exceeded it leads to shrinkage happening in concrete. The lower cement content decreases the bondage between the concrete materials reducing concrete strength. So using the proper amount of cement content is essential.

AbstractThe aim of this research is to find an optimum combination of silie admixtures and epoxy dispersion additives which would positively influence the durability and mechanical properties of concretes made of concrete recyclate. The durability of concrete is dependent on its cover layer permeability and also on the overall permeability of concrete recyclate.

Your question has been asked in general and it would be better to specify what kinds of additives you are considering and under what conditions the durability of concrete is going to be assessed because durability of concrete can be defined as the ability of concrete to resist weathering action chemical attack and abrasion while maintaining its desired engineering properties.
