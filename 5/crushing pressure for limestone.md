High pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) are used for size reduction or rocks and ores. They compress the feed material between two rotating rollers one of which is in a fixed position and another roller that is floating. The two rotating rollers generate such a high pressure that it grinds the feed material to the desired smaller grain size.
