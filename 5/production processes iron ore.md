Steel is mainly produced via two different process routes: the path from "iron ore to steel" and the path from "scrap to steel". With the iron-ore based route hot metal is mostly produced from iron oxide ores in blast furnaces and more rarely in smelting reduction plants and is processed to make crude steel in oxygen converters.
