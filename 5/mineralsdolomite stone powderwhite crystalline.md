 · Marble is a metamorphic rock formed when limestone is subjected to high pressure or heat. In its pure form marble is a white stone with a crystalline and sugary appearance consisting of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Usually marble contains other minerals including quartz graphite pyrite and iron oxides.These minerals can give marble a pink brown gray green or variegated coloration.

 · Dolomite differs from calcite because of the presence of magnesium. • Calcite reacts quickly with acids and produce carbon dioxide bubbles. But dolomite is weakly reacts with acids producing bubbles very slowly. When hot acids or powdered dolomite is used they may react quickly. • Dolomite is slightly harder and denser than calcite.
