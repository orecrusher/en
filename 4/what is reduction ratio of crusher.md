 · Crushing setting: Efficiency. Ideally the reduction ratio of a jaw crusher should be 6:1. There are different ways to calculate reduction ratio but the best way is something called the P80 factor. The reduction ratio is then calculated by comparing the input feed size passing 80 per cent versus the discharge size that passes 80 per cent.

The number of bits used in each sample directly affects the signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of the digital signal specifically by determining the amplitude of a kind of noise called quantization noise that is similar to low-pass-filtered white noise. Resolution reduction intentionally reduces the number of bits used for audio samples.
