## Gold Mining 
Mines and gold mining operations have become increasingly geographically diverse far removed from the concentrated supply of four decades or so ago when the vast majority of the world's gold came from South Africa. China was the largest gold producer in the world in 2016 accounting for around 14% of total annual production.

 · Quicksilver (mercury) was absolutely essential in hard rock mining because it was used to separate the gold from the rock it was found in. The fact that the New Almaden Mine was already in operation when gold was discovered in our state only quickened the pace of the gold rush itself.

## Mercury Usage in Gold Mining and Why It Is a Problem
 · How Mercury Is Used in Gold Mining. First mercury is mixed with the materials containing gold. A mercury-gold amalgam then is formed because gold will dissolve in the mercury while other impurities will not. The mixture of gold and mercury is then heated to a temperature that will vaporize the mercury leaving behind the gold.
