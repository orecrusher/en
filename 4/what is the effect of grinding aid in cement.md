## Modern grinding aids and their influence on the hydraulic 
 · Summary: In this paper the influence of different surface properties on the mode of action of modern grinding aids based on polycarboxylatether (PCE) is investigated during the separate grinding of granulated blastfurnace slag (GBFS). The effects on a laboratory grinding process as well as the effects on the hydraulic reactivity of the material being ground are described.
