## Surface mining – strip open pit mountaintop removal 
Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed. It is the other way of underground mining in which the overlying rock is left behind and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.. Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface

## A Brief Introduction to the Types of Surface Mining Methods
Strip mining (see coal mining ) open-pit (or open-cut) mining and quarrying are the most common mining methods that start from the earth's surface and maintain exposure to the surface throughout the extraction period. The excavation usually has stepped or benched side slopes and can reach depths as low as 1500 ft (460 m).
