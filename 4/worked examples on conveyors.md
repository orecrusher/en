## Safety Factsheet: Hazards of Conveyors
Conveyors are used to transport materials horizontally vertically at an angle or around curves. Hazards depend on the type of conveyer the material conveyed the loion of the conveyor and how close the conveyer is to workers. Conveyors eliminate or reduce manual material handling tasks but they

## Conveyor Safety 
 · Conveyors are safe when used correctly but they can be dangerous and even deadly if workers fail to follow safety procedures when working on or around them. Materials should be placed on the conveyor so that they will ride safely. When removing material off conveyors workers should remain alert and safeguard their hands; the moving material

## Material Handling Equipment: Selection and Maintenance
Belt conveyors are substituted for roller conveyors when the parts are small and are required to be transferred separately from one station to another. The mechanism of transporting the materials in a drag conveyor can be a screw (as in automatic feed in poultry farms) a pusher bar a scraper (for moving granular or powder materials) or an overhead endless chain along a fixed path.
