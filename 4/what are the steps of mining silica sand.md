## What is Silica Sand? (with pictures) 
A person sandblasting using silica sand. The most common mineral in the Earth's continental crust is quartz and most silica sand is made up of broken down quartz crystals.Silica is another name for silicon dioxide SiO2 of which quartz is a specific latticed structure. So silica sand is quartz that over the years through the work of water and wind has been broken down into tiny granules.

## Silicon Silies and Silicosis 
 · Silicon and oxygen are by far the most abundant elements available in the Earth's crust. Minerals that have any sort of combination of silicon and oxygen are referred to as silies and have the highest concentration in the Earth's surface. In fact according to my Earth System Science class silies make up about 90% of Earth's crust mass.

## Silica Sand 
 · Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.
