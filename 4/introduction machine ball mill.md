## Ball Milling 
Ball milling is a way to exfoliate graphite using lateral force as opposed to the Scotch Tape or soniion that mainly use normal force. Ball mills like the three roll machine are a common occurrence in industry for the production of fine particles. During the ball milling process there are two factors that contribute to the exfoliation.

## Ball Mill 
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.
