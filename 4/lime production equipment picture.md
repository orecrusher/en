## Lime Slakers 
Lime slakers are an important tool for converting calcium oxide (CaO) which is also known as quicklime or pebble lime into a calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) slurry. Quicklime is a popular alternative to purchasing hydrated lime because it is more affordable and requires around 75 percent less of the chemical by weight as hydrated lime meaning less storage space handling and freight are needed.
