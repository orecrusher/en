a processing plant one should carry out laboratory tests particularly tailored to the possible processing combinations. In the last decades RAG and DMT carried out extensive tests in laboratories and technical schools with a large number of different raw coal qualities. A pilot plant with a feeding capacity of 70 t/h was built. Figure 7.

## An Introduction to CO2 Separation and Capture Technologies
The process of producing this CO 2 stream is referred to as separation and capture which encompasses all operations that take place at the power plant site Coal is gasified to form synthesis gas ( syngas) of CO and H 2. The gas then undergoes the water-gas shift where the CO is reacted with steam to form CO 2 and H 2.

Most coals as they are dug from the ground have some amount of moisture associated with them. Gentle heating of coal at a temperature slightly above the boiling point of water causes a loss of weight from the sample that is defined as moisture. The moisture content of coals ranges from about 5% to almost 70%. Moisture is an undesirable

## What is coal where is it found? 
Coal is a fossil fuel formed from vegetation which has been consolidated between other rock strata and altered by the combined effects of pressure and heat over millions of years to form coal seams. The energy we get from coal today comes from the energy that plants absorbed from the sun millions of years ago. Types of coal.
