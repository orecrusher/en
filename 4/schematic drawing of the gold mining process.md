In production planning the first decision involves which type of production process —the way a good or service is created—best fits with company goals and customer demand. An important consideration is the type of good or service being produced because different

The gold is then dropped into the beginning of the vortex mat (8). This process is repeated in each of the Gold Cube's separation trays. In mining the low pressure zone behind a riffle— in a sluice or dredge— is called an eddy. The eddy rolls horizontally and the vortex churns vertically like a tornado.

The lifecycle of a gold mine. People in hard hats working underground is what often comes to mind when thinking about how gold is mined. Yet mining the ore is just one stage in a long and complex gold mining process. Long before any gold can be extracted significant exploration and development needs to take place both to determine as accurately as possible the size of the deposit as well
