## Opencast Mining 
Coal is mined either by surface methods (open-cut or open-cast mining) or by underground techniques. In surface mining all of the rock from the ground surface to the top of the seam (material referred to as overburden) is removed and set aside to expose the coal which is then taken out and transported from the mine for preparation and use ( Figure 11 ).
