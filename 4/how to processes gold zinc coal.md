 · You can remove the most common metals found in gold ore (copper zinc and lead) using elements that bond with oxygen at lower temperatures than gold. This oxidation process will make copper oxide zinc oxide and lead oxide — all of which are less dense than pure gold and will float to the top of your crucible allowing the slag to be sloughed off.

## How Is Gold Formed? Origins and Process
 · Gold sank to the Earth's core during the planet's formation. It's only accessible today because of asteroid bombardment. Theoretically it's possible to form gold by the nuclear processes of fusion fission and radioactive decay. It's easiest for scientists to transmute gold by bombarding the heavier element mercury and producing gold via decay.
