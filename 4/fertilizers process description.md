## Chapter 3: Fertilizers as water pollutants
Generally in soils that are not waterlogged soil N (held as protein in plant matter) and fertilizer-N are microbiologically transformed to NH 4 (ammonium) through the process of ammonifiion. The ammonium ion is oxidized by two groups of bacteria (Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter) to NO 3 with an unstable intermediate NO 2 product in a process called nitrifiion.

Phosphate fertilizer in its liquid form can be easily applied to fields and crops. The process by which phosphate rock is converted to phosphate fertilizer involves treatment with sulfuric acid; the result is often called "super phosphate."This treatment with sulfuric acid draws the phosphates from the raw ore and creates a water soluble form.
