## Induction Heating for Welding Appliions
With induction welding the heat is electromagnetically induced in the workpiece. The speed and accuracy of induction welding makes it ideal for edge welding of tubes and pipes. In this process pipes pass an induction coil at high speed. As they do so their edges are heated then squeezed together to form a longitudinal weld seam.

 · The seam was then welded using a welding ball and the heated pipe was passed between rollers which forced the seam together to create a bond. The welds produced by lap welding are not as reliable as those created using more modern methods. Lap Welding is no longer used as a major process for pipe manufacturing.
