## 8 Main Cement Ingredients Their Functions 
Cement as a binding material is a very important building material. Almost every construction work requires cement. Therefore the composition of cement is a matter of great interest to engineers. For understanding cement composition one must know the functionality of Cement ingredients.

## Chemical Composition of Cement 
Chemical Composition of Cement The raw materials used for the manufacture of cement consist mainly of lime silica alumina and iron oxide. These oxides interact with one another in the kiln at high temperature to form more complex compounds.
