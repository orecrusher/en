## Primary Grinding Mills 
Rod mills are used for primary grinding of materials with a top size of 2030 mm somewhat higher for soft materials. The production of fines is low and consequently a rod mill is the right machine when a steep particle size distribution curve is desired. A product with 80 minus 500 microns can be obtained in an economical manner.

Ball mill uses steel ball as grinding medium. Because the steel ball is in point contact with the ore the grinding products are of high fineness and the particle size of the products is relatively fine which is prone to over grinding so ball mill is not suitable for the re-selection production line in ore dressing.
