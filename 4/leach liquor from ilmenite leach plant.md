 · Ilmenite is the most abundant mineral for the extraction of titanium. It contains more than 50% TiO2 along with iron silica and alumina. The spinel structure of ilmenite (FeO·TiO2) is such that iron is bound in the lattice of TiO2 matrix. To remove iron from the ilmenite is a major task for process metallurgists. Various processes have been applied to remove this iron. One of them is
