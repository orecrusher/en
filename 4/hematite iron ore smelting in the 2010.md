## the extraction process of the procedure used hematite iron
How Is Iron Extracted From the EarthMar magnetite and hematite are iron oxides however the extraction of iron from an iron oxide involves a series of steps that begins when mined iron ore is crushed into smaller pieces by a crusher and then washed the second step in the process is calcination or roasting of the ore which removes certain impurities carbon dioxide and other

## EXTRACTION OF IRON
CaO now reacts the impurities of ore called GANGUE to form slag. Slag is the mixture of CaSiO 3 and Ca(AlO 2) 2. The slag floats over the top of molten iron. Slag is a useful byproduct. It is used in road making cement manufacturing a light weight building materials.

## Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineral
Hematite is one of the most abundant minerals on Earth's surface and in the shallow crust. It is an iron oxide with a chemical composition of Fe 2 O 3. It is a common rock-forming mineral found in sedimentary metamorphic and igneous rocks at loions throughout the world. Hematite is the most important ore of iron.

Iron Ore: Iron ore occurs principally as two types of minerals: hematite and magnetite. Hematite of high quality (90-98% Fe2O3) occurs at Butare in Kabale district; Kashenyi Kyanyamuzinda and Kamena in Kisoro district with total resources in excess of 50 million tons which contains negligible sulphur phosphorus and titanium.

Under 100% smelted iron also has a chance to consume 1 gold without producing steel. Bonus Ingots. The base output if iron at level 0 smelting is 5 iron bars per 10 hematite and charcoal. This rate goes up by one bar every 2-3 levels (2.5 average) up to 45 iron bars per 10 hematite and charcoal at level 100 smelting.
