The equipment for drying sand mainly are rotary sand dryer machine which is to use the high temperature air to heat and dry the wet sand directly and evaporate the water into water vapor. After the sand drying process the moisture content of sand can be reduced to be about 3% or even bone dry as need. In sand production reasonable drying of sand with high water content is an important process.
