## The leaching and adsorption behaviour of gold ores 
There are many non-idealities in gold processing which are becoming increasingly important as simple free-milling oxide ores are depleted. During cyanidation and adsorption onto activated carbon these effects include competing metal-cyanide complexes preg-robbing and the mineralogy of the ore. This thesis considers these areas from an experimental and modelling viewpoint.
