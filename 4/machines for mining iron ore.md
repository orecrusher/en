By using ore sorting equipment ore concentrates can be created at very low cost in small or remote mining installations. The entire processing line can be planned in semi-mobile form and consists only of crushers screens belts and sorting machines. This allows immense cost savings for transport since the waste rock is disposed of on-site.

## Iron ore 
The world will need iron ore for as long as the world needs steel. In 2020 we produced around 280 million tonnes of iron ore. That's enough to make the steel for more than 3300 Sydney Harbour Bridges. We're building a new iron ore mine in Western Australia. When completed South Flank will produce high-quality iron ore for around 25 years.
