## Detection of tramp metal 
Tramp metal such as bucket teeth drill bits bore crowns tools and more left in mined material and stock piles present a significant risk of blocking or damaging primary crushers. In addition high-energy ejection of tramp metal – specifically Ground Engagement Tools (GET) – from crushers pose a serious safety risk to the operations staff.

## PQ University Lesson 7
 · Jaw crusher units with extra-long articulated crusher jaws prevent coarse material from blocking while moving all mounting elements of the crusher jaw from the wear area. A more even material flow may be affected if the transfer from the prescreen or the feeder trough is designed so material simply tilts into the crushing jaw.

Crushers play an important role in the material handling process for underground mine operations. The main purpose of a crusher is the size reduction of the feed. This size reduction is achieved by applying a force to the material creating cracks in the material which in the end will cause the material to break into smaller pieces.
