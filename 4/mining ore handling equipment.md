Abstract: The ore handling system layout plays a fundamental role in cave mining projects not only because it is one of the main drivers in the production capacity and reliability of the mining system but also because it is a fundamental variable in the footprint's development time and cost (Paredes et al. 2016). In terms of ore handling system definition the governing paradigm in Codelco

 · Similarly in surface mines the down-hole analysis of ore in blast holes could lead to more efficient materials handling by identifying ore and waste constituents. Equally important to improving the performance of materials-handling machinery will be the development of new technologies for monitoring equipment status and for specific automation needs.
