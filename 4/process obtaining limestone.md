The process by which limestone (calcium carbonate) is converted to quicklime by heating then to slaked lime by hydration and naturally reverts to calcium carbonate by carbonation is called the lime cycle. The conditions and compounds present during each step of the lime cycle have a strong influence of the end product thus the complex and varied physical nature of lime products.
