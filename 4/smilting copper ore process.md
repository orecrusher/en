## A Poor Man's Method of Smelting Gold 
 · You can remove the most common metals found in gold ore (copper zinc and lead) using elements that bond with oxygen at lower temperatures than gold. This oxidation process will make copper oxide zinc oxide and lead oxide — all of which are less dense than pure gold and will float to the top of your crucible allowing the slag to be sloughed off.

## copper smelting process and methods
Copper Smelting: Smelting is a metallurgy technique to extract base metals from their ores with the help of heat and a chemical reducing agent. (Click here for extraction process). Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica) calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace.

## Egyptian Copper Smelting Process 
The Egyptian copper smelting process utilized a 'bowl furnace' which was supplied additional air to raise the temperature of the fire through the usage of foot bellows. Malachite and azurite were used as a source ore for the copper charcoal was used as the reducing agent to separate oxygen from the copper and iron ore was used as the 'flux' to bind and float away impurities.
