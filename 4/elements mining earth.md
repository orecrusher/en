## What are Rare Earth Elements? 
Rare earths are a series of chemical elements found in the earth's crust that are vital to many modern technologies Extensive processing is required to separate rare earth elements from mined ore While the elements themselves aren't rare ore bodies containing sufficient concentrations to make processing economically viable are exceedingly rare.

Μining waste processing by-products and mine water discharges pose a serious threat to the environment as in many cases they contain high concentrations of toxic substances. However they may also be valuable resources. The main target of the current review is the comparative study of the occurrence of rare earth elements (REE) in mining waste and mine water discharges produced from

## Not So "Green" Technology: The Complied Legacy of Rare 
 · For every ton of rare earth produced the mining process yields 13kg of dust cubic meters of waste gas 75 cubic meters of wastewater and one ton of radioactive residue. This stems from the fact that rare earth element ores have metals that when mixed with leaching pond chemicals contaminate air water and soil.

## Visualizing China's Dominance in Rare Earth Metals
 · Increasing rare earth mining outside of China has reduced China's global share of mining down from 97.7% in 2010 to 62.9% in 2019. But mining is merely one piece of the puzzle. Ultimately the large majority of rare earth refining 80% resides in China. Therefore even rare earths mined overseas are sent to China for final processing.

## Environmental Damage 
Mining. The physical process of removing the ores from the ground is disruptive to the environment. Most rare earth elements are mined through open pit mining which involves opening the surface of the earth using heavy equipment and machinery. Creating this disruption on the surface of the earth disrupts thriving ecosystems.
