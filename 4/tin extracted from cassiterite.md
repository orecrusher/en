## how is tin extracted from tin ore rocks
Cassiterite is by far the most important tin ore although small amounts of tin are recovered from sulphide minerals such as stannite (Cu2FeSnS4) but they are more difficult to process. Primary deposits can occur within the granite or within pegmatities or aplites (dyke like rocks) associated with the granite.

## How is tin extracted from its ore? – restaurantnorman
 · Tin is extracted from various ores chiefly from Cassiterite (SnO2). The metal is produced from reducing the oxide ore with coal in a furnace. What is tin used for now? Most of the tin that is used today is used to make cans that can hold food and other items. Tin is perfect for lining steel cans because it doesn't corrode and it's not

## HOW TO EXTRACT TIN ORE FROM CASSITERITE WHAT IS THE TIN 
 · At present most of the tin concentrate sent to the smelter is the product of shaker beneficiation. Jigs are mostly used for the purifiion of coarse and medium-sized cassiterite. The spiral concentrator is used to recover cassiterite with a size of 0.074~1mm. For the sludge smaller than 37μm it is mainly purified by centrifuge and sluice box.

## Mineral Resources in Uganda – Tin 
Tin in Uganda is found in its ore known as cassiterite. It has a number of uses that include coating other metals to avoid rusting. It is used with lead to make solder and when it is mixed with copper it makes bronze. Tin was the first mineral to be mined in Uganda in 1927. During the period between 1927- 1960 Uganda exported 9518 tons of tin

## Who Discovered Tin? 
Tin needs to be extracted from cassiterite. It can be found in other sulfides like teallite and franckeite. But for commercial purposes extracting from cassiterite remains the most viable option. There are many ways to obtain tin. The most common is the dredging. Another popular choice is open cast mining. The use of tin is still increasing.
