## How a Coal Plant Works 
How a Coal Plant Works. Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced under tremendous pressure flows into a turbine which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.

## Coal
Coal for Electricity Generation In the United States 52% of the electricity comes from coal generation. A typical coal fired power plant like the one in this picture heats water to 540 deg C to produce high pressure steam. To produce 10 9 kWh/year of power the plant burns 14000 tons of coal every day.
