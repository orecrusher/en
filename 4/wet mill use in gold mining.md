By the 1830s miners at Reed Gold Mine and other North Carolina mines started using Chilean Mills and Arrastra Mills to crush the quartz and use mercury to extract the gold. How the Chilean Mill came to North Carolina remains a mystery but this mining apparatus became the most common way to extract gold from quartz by 1830.

## Wet Milling Process 
Wet milling also called wet media milling is a process in which particles are dispersed in a liquid by shearing by impact or crushing or by attrition. A mill is charged with media (small beads or spheres) and activated by a high-speed agitator shaft to separate the individual particles.

## Gold extraction 
Among free-milling gold ores placer gold is a special case as there is no pre-treatment required for gold extraction. Gold can be extracted from placer ores using physical separation techniques particularly through gravity treatment. In modern practice concentrators use centrifugal force in order to liberate finer gold particles.
