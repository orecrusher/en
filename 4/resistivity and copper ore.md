## Electrical resistivity and conductivity 
Electrical resistivity (also called specific electrical resistance or volume resistivity) is a fundamental property of a material that measures how strongly it resists electric current.Its inverse called electrical conductivity quantifies how well a material conducts electricity. A low resistivity indies a material that readily allows electric current.

It takes a brass alloy of 94% copper (which visually appears as regular copper not brass) to lose only half the conductivity of pure copper. If high conductivity is needed it's better to plate pure copper or laminate it rather than alloy it.

## 9.4: Resistivity and Resistance 
 · Copper has the highest electrical conductivity rating and therefore the lowest resistivity rating of all nonprecious metals. Also important is the tensile strength where the tensile strength is a measure of the force required to pull an object to the point where it breaks.

Copper can also maintain solidity at 1083C and boils at 2567C. Like most metals as the temperature goes up so does the resistivity. Because of these factors copper is widely used for electrical purposes such as electrical wires electrical machinery and generators and is able to withstand the elements to be used in outdoor power lines.

I would like to know the resistivity of copper at 540 degrees C assuming it is 1.72  10^-8 Ohmm²/m at 20 degrees C. The temp coefficient of resistivity is .00393 at 20 degrees C but using this I get a result of around 5.31 at 540 degrees. But a problem I am solving says it is closer to 4.30. I am having trouble resolving the difference.
