## Ironmaking 101 – From Ore to Iron with Blast Furnaces 
 · Iron ores with lower iron content such as taconite are first processed to concentrate the iron level and drive off volatile impurities. The iron ore is dressed or crushed into 0.5-1 in. chunks which increases surface area for reactions. Magnetic separation is used to remove some of the undesirable minerals or gangue in the crushed ore.

## Iron 
Iron from food comes in two forms: heme and non-heme. Heme is found only in animal flesh like meat poultry and seafood. Non-heme iron is found in plant foods like whole grains nuts seeds legumes and leafy greens. Non-heme iron is also found in animal flesh (as animals consume plant foods with non-heme iron) and fortified foods.

 · The use of these resources corresponds with the principles of sustainability because the rate at which we are consuming them does not affect their availability in the long term. In contrast non-renewable resources are those that are available to us in limited quantities or those that are renewed so slowly that the rate at which they are consumed is too fast.

Scrap-based production (also referred to as secondary or recycled production) can be valuable in reducing energy demand and CO 2 emissions as it is considerably less energy-intensive than primary production from iron ore. Scrap is used as the main ferrous feed in electric arc furnaces (EAFs) as well as in induction furnaces to a lesser extent.
