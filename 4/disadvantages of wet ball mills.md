## Corn Milling: Wet vs. Dry Milling 
While the wet milling process is capital intensive with higher operating costs the ability to produce a variety of products can be valuable in dealing with volatile markets. The wet milling process results in slightly lower ethanol yields than a traditional dry milling process since some of the fermentable starch exits the process attached to the saleable co-products.
