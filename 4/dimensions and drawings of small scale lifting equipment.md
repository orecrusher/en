## How to resize or rescale an AutoCAD drawing 
AutoCAD 2D drawings are commonly drawn in model space at a 1:1 scale (full-size). In other words a 12-foot wall is drawn at that size. The drawings are then plotted or printed at a plot "scale" that accurately resizes the model objects to fit on paper at a given scale such as 1/8" = 1'. In some drawings data in model space hasn't been drawn at a 1:1 scale. Among the reasons are user errors

Once you consider the dimension of a lift another important feature is the load capacity of the elevator. After choosing an elevator you have to take care that you never overload your lift.

## Plot Plan 
Plot plans of larger facilities are often at too small a scale for all of the smaller pieces of equipment to be loed by co-ordinates and equipment tag numbers due to the physical constraints of placing the text on the drawing. Therefore equipment loion plans are created at a larger scale e.g. 1:400. Several equipment loion plans are required to cover the same area as the plot plan
