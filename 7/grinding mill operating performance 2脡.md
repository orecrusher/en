Mill Type Overview. Three types of mill design are common. The Overflow Discharge mill is best suited for fine grinding to 75 – 106 microns.; The Diaphram or Grate Discharge mill keeps coarse particles within the mill for additional grinding and typically used for grinds to 150 – 250 microns.; The Center-Periphery Discharge mill has feed reporting from both ends and the product discharges

## Ball Mill Critical Speed 
 · The critical speed of a rotating mill is the RPM at which a grinding medium will begin to "centrifuge" namely will start rotating with the mill and therefore cease to carry out useful work. Ball mills have been successfully run at speeds between 60 and 90 percent of critical speed but most mills operate at speeds between 65 and 79 percent of critical speed.

## Optimizing your SAG mill operation 
 · The mill discharge from these mills consists of slurry which goes to the ball mills for further grinding and coarse pebbles/rocks which are crushed and sent back to the mill. To maximize the capacity of these circuits the general practice is to use grates with pebble ports (reaching 100 mm) instead of normal grate openings to increase the pebble removal.
