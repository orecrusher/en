## Copper Mining and Production Processes Explained
Mining. The ore is removed from the ground in either open pit or underground mines. Underground – sinking a vertical shaft into the earth to reach the copper ore and driving horizontal tunnels into the ore. Open-pit – 90% of ore is mined using the open pit method. Ores near the surface can be quarried after removal of the surface layers.

## Environmental Risks of Mining
Open pit mining. Open pit mining where material is excavated from an open pit is one of the most common forms of mining for strategic minerals. This type of mining is particularly damaging to the environment because strategic minerals are often only available in small concentrations which increases the amount of ore needed to be mined.
