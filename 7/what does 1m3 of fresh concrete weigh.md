## Weight/Volume of blue metal 
 · A few of the guys have given pointers in regards to weight. Bluestone does vary in weight depends on the quarry it comes from. It could be lightweight stone or heavy weight stone. Ask the supplier. There is such a thing as lightweight concrete which of course uses lightweight aggregate/stone etc. Can't remember what they use it for.

Harley thank you for the quick response. To further expound upon my question as a general rule we use the following factor to determine/estimate the weight of concrete for removal purposes: 12.5lbs. x thickness x size. So in this example a 1ft. x 1ft. x 6" thick slab area weighs approx. 75lbs.

## Density of Concrete 
The unit weight is determined by the formula below. Subtract the weight of the measuring base from the combined weight of the measuring base and the concrete it contains. Next divide this weight (in pounds) by the volume of the measuring base (cubic feet) to obtain the density expressed as lb/ft 3: D = (Mc – Mm) / Vm. D.
