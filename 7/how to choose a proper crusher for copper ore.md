## How it Works: Crushers Grinding Mills and Pulverizers 
 · Industrial crushers reduce large rocks ore or waste materials to smaller sizes by impact or pressure to fracture or deform the material. During the primary crushing operation boulder size feeds from 20 to 100 in. are reduced to secondary crusher sizes of 1 to 20 in. or mill feed size of .5 to 3 in.

## How to obtain better product shape for multi
For fine crushing a 10/50mm feed compared with spring cone crusher the multi-cylinder cone crusher can obtain better grain shape which can achieve the effect of vertical shaft shaping. As mentioned above the small crushing cavity can set and maintain a smaller discharge opening so it is easier to obtain a good particle shape with a small crushing cavity.

 · The medium crushing capacity is 144t/h the feed size is less than 200mm and the output size is less than 30-80mm. The processing capacity of the roller crusher is too small and the investment in the standard cone crusher is too high. Therefore it is recommended to choose hammer crushers and impact crushers for medium crushing crushers.
