## Mill (grinding) 
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding crushing or cutting. Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them. Historically mills were powered by hand or by animals (e.g. via a hand crank) working animal (e.g. horse mill) wind or water ().

## Crushing Vs Grinding 
Crushing is usually a dry process while milling is performed with water. The advantage of wet milling is the lower energy input compared to dry milling. Additionally some chemical reagents can be used to minimize the energy consumption of grinding because grinding energy is minimum at pH of the point of zero electrical charges of the material surface which is known as Rebinder effect.
