## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining Extraction
The barren rock or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore. By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper iron and sometimes other metals. Such ores originate from sulfur-bearing volcanic magmas which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.
