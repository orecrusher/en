Any copper(I) oxide present will be converted into copper(I) sulfide during the smelting process because copper has a higher affinity for sulfur than it does for oxygen. for example: Cu 2 O + FeS → Cu 2 S + FeO. Impurities form a slag which floats on the surface and is easily removed. One of the reactions to remove iron impurities is shown below:
