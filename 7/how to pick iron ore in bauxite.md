A process of removing iron from bauxite ore is described. The ore is firstly reduced in CO and H 2 atmosphere to convert iron contamination of bauxite to magnetite or elemental iron. Then material is finely crushed and passed through the magnetic separation. Short characterisation of green and preheated bauxite is done by using XRD XRF and EPMA.
