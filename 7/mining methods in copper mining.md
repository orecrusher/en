## Mining Techniques of the Sierra Nevada and Gold Country
Hydraulic mining was a variation on ground sluicing where the water delivered to the site would be shot through a nozzle at high pressure onto the face of the cliff thereby washing away tons of boulders gravel dirt and gold. The first use of this method is credited to Edward Mattison in 1853.

## Early Mining In England's Cornwall 
 · As hard rock mining developed and locals were trained by German miners Cornwall England slowly emerged as a source of copper and tin. By the 1700's Cornish miners called "Cousin Jacks" had solved many of the earlier mining problems and were considered some of the best at extracting ore. Their skills were in demand all over the world.
