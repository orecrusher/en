## Representation of Plant Hydraulics in the Noah‐MP Land 
In this study we present a novel plant hydraulics scheme (PHS) to represent plant water stress and the regulation of stomatal conductance for use in the Noah-MP land surface model. Our results show Noah-MP-PHS performs better in its water and carbon simulations than the default Noah-MP with traditional SHSs especially under dry soil conditions.

The hydraulic self-contained safety system (HSCSS) is a highly reliable control system for shutdown valves (SDV) or surface safety valves (SSV). The low-cost HSCSS is designed specifically for remote loions where external power sources are not available. However it functions equally well in all appliions requiring a basic shutdown system

the medium called its hydraulic conductivity and is also proportional to the slope of the water surface or hydraulic gradient. The hydraulic gradient is a measure of the energy available to overcome the resistance to flow and the greater the gradient the more energy is available. Darcy's equation only applies to laminar not turbulent flow.

## Hydraulic pumping surface equipment 
 · Hydraulic pumping systems have evolved toward the use of relatively high pressures and low flow rates to reduce friction losses and to increase the lift capability and efficiency of the system. Surface operating pressures are generally between 2000 and 4000 psi with the higher pressures used in deeper wells and power-fluid rates may range from a few hundred to more than 3000 B/D.
