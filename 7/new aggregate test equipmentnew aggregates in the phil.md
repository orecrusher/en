## Aggregates 
 · Aggregates are evaluated through tests to determine their suitability for various appliions. Mineralogy grain size and texture and petrographic description of rock samples are also used to evaluate suitability. Types of Aggregates Coarse Aggregate. Coarse-grained aggregates will not pass through a sieve with 4.75 mm openings (No. 4).
