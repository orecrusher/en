## Sand mining grinds down river systems and sparks floods 
 · Unsustainable sand mining transforms the structure of rivers. By removing more than the river can naturally replace with the sediment it carries downstream sand mining carves a deeper narrower bed. This lowers the water level speeds up flow and erodes banks – reducing the watershed's capacity to absorb excess water during floods.
