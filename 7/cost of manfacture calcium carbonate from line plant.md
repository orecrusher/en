## Lime 
Quicklime is calcium oxide (CaO) which has varying particle size depending on the end use and high available calcium content. Quicklime is produced by burning or calcining limestone (calcium carbonate) in a kiln at 2000 degrees +/-. Quicklime is used primarily in flue gas treatment of sulphur emissions water and wastewater treatment soil amendment processing well drilling appliions

## Waterlines clogged? Descale without disassembly 
To molders scale caused by calcium in hard water is a devil that forms as water flows through pipes contaminating and clogging lines throughout a plant. When scale builds up in the pipes and heat exchangers on a molding machine's hydraulic system it causes poor heat transfer which prevents molders from running their machines at full capacity.

## Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) 
Precipitated Calcium Carbonate. PCC stands for Precipitated Calcium Carbonate—also known as purified refined or synthetic calcium carbonate. It has the same chemical formula as other types of calcium carbonate such as limestone marble and chalk: CaCO3. The calcium carbon and oxygen atoms can arrange themselves in three different ways to form three different calcium carbonate

Calcium looping Wikipedia. Calcium looping (CaL) or the regenerative calcium cycle (RCC) is a secondgeneration carbon capture technology. It is the most developed form of carbonate looping where a metal (M) is reversibly reacted between its carbonate form (MCO 3) and its oxide form (MO) to separate carbon dioxide from other gases coming from either power generation or an industrial plant.
