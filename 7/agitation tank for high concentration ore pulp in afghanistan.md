## Pachuca Tank 
 · Pachuca tanks are used for a wide variety of leaching and mixing operations in the minerals industry. Previously an equation was derived to predict the circulation in a Pachuca tank with full height draft tube risers. This analysis was subsequently verified with data from a large bore air-water flow loop used. However the equation was based on the assumption that the solids settling velocity

Carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp are continuous processes that use activated carbon in a cascade of large agitated tanks which have been widely used to recover or concentrate precious metals in gold extraction plants. In the carbon-in-pulp process adsorption occurs after the leaching cascade section of the plant and in the carbon-in-leach process leaching and adsorption occur simultaneously.

The high intensity of the Jameson Cell means that it is much shorter than conventional column flotation cells (see Figure 1) and it does not require air compressors to aerate the suspension of ground ore particles and water (known as a slurry or pulp) in the flotation cell. The lack of a requirement for compressed air and the lack of moving parts means that power consumption is less than for

ore on a simple liner (heap leaching) or more efficiently in a stirred tank (agitated leaching). More concentrated or richer ores make the more expensive techniques cost effective. Many mines will process both low-grade and high-grade ores. The low-grade ore will be slowly leached over 60 to 90 days with a 0.1 % sodium cyanide solution.
