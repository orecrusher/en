Mined through the use of wells drilled to sulphur deposits and worked with the "Frasch" method; Extracted from the oil or gas stream at a processing plant; Scraped from the surface of the earth or dug out of open pits. "Crude" sulfur is produced from the Frasch process or recovered from "sour" natural gas or petroleum.

The sulfur content can be reduced to less than 0.5 percent and a high-strength (10 percent) sulfur dioxide gas is forwarded to a sulfuric acid plant. The process is thermally efficient and the resulting calcine is in the form of small particles that can easily be leached into solution for further treatment.
