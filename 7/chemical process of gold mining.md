## Mining Techniques of the Sierra Nevada and Gold Country
Hydraulic mining was a variation on ground sluicing where the water delivered to the site would be shot through a nozzle at high pressure onto the face of the cliff thereby washing away tons of boulders gravel dirt and gold. The first use of this method is credited to Edward Mattison in 1853.

## How Is Gold Formed? Origins and Process
 · Gold is a chemical element easily recognized by its yellow metallic color. It is valuable because of its rarity resistance to corrosion electrical conductivity malleability ductility and beauty. If you ask people where gold comes from most will say you obtain it from a mine pan for flakes in a stream or extract it from seawater.

Gold's Chemical Qualities# Gold is a chemical element so it can only be found not manufactured. It is largely inert which means:- (i) It is almost totally immune to decay (ii) it is not very useful in any industrial/chemical processes which use it up and (iii) it is easy to store cheaply for long periods.

## Mining Technology in the Nineteenth Century 
Miners used chemicals heat and electricity to process more complex metal and mineral compounds. Silver for example often occurs in the compound argentite (silver sulfide) or in lead compounds. Historically the key chemical processes included amalgamation with mercury and leaching in a solution of chlorine sodium or calcium hyposulfite (lixiviation) or cyanide.

## Mineral Extraction 
Mineral extraction (mining) and petroleum and gas production are major resource extraction activities that provide the raw materials to support our economic infrastructure. An enormous amount of pollution is generated from the extraction and use of natural resources. The Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Releases Inventory report lists mining as the single largest source of toxic waste

 · Gold miners have to smelt their gold in order to remove impurities resulting in pure gold. Most large scale gold miners send their ore to smelters with large equipment for the smelting process. Small scale miners still can do their own smelting using specialized kilns. Many people confuse gold smelting with melting.
