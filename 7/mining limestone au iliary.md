## Limestone—A Crucial and Versatile Industrial Mineral Commodity
Some Issues in Limestone Mining. Limestone is most often mined from a quarry. However underground limestonemines are found at places in the central and eastern United States especially in and near cities. Underground mining of lime - stone has some advantages over surface quarrying and will probably increase in the future.

## Quarry 
Stone quarry is an outdated term for mining construction rocks (limestone marble granite sandstone etc.). There are open types (called quarries or open-pit mines) and closed types ( mines and caves). For thousands of years only hand tools have been used in quarries. In the 18th century the use of drilling and blasting operations was

Underground Limestone Mining by Robert M. McKay and Michael J. Bounk The production of limestone aggregate from underground workings requires machinery to illuminate the rock face and to hoist miners into position to clean drill holes and load explosives for blasting the rock.
