Flyrock is one of the most important environmental and hazardous issues in mine blasting which can affect equipment and people and may lead to fatal accidents. Therefore prediction and minimization of this phenomenon are crucial objectives of many rock removal projects. This study is aimed to predict the flyrock distance with the use of machine learning techniques.
