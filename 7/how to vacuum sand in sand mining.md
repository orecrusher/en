## In situ oil sands mining 
Oil sands deposits that are greater than 75 meters below the ground surface are usually extracted without removing the overlying rock and dirt. This is known as in situ oil sands mining. Oil sands deposits are usually split into two types of deposits. Shallow deposits are loed within approximately 75 meters of the ground surface and are extracted using surface mining methods.

Oil sands bitumen can be extracted by two methods: mining and in-situ. Reserves near the surface can only be accessed through mining. In this process the bitumen is dug up mixed with water and agitated to separate the bitumen from the sand and clay. Mining operations require the removal of all vegetation and top soil to access the raw oil sands.
