The froth phase floats on top of the pulp phase and is formed by the bubbles that break through the surface of the pulp phase. The water in the flotation cell is conditioned to promote the formation of a more or less stable froth. The bubbles do not burst when they cross the interface and each one carries a skin of water into the froth phase.

## Flotation Froth 
Froth flotation is a process that selectively separates materials based upon whether they are water repelling (hydrophobic) or have an affinity for water (hydrophilic). Importantly the word flotation is also used in the literature to describe the process in density separation in which lighter microplastics float to the surface of a salt solution.

## Advancing flotation process technologies to maximise gold 
 · A flotation process is one method used throughout the industry to recover gold. It's a very cost-effective method for concentrating gold and is a desirable process used for the upgrading of low-sulphide and refractory ore for further gold recovery treatment. Froth flotation is a process used to selectively separate hydrophobic materials from

## Froth flotation process and its appliion
Froth flotation is one of the steps which is generally performed before roasting and it deals with the surface chemistry of liquids and of the minerals to be separated. This process requires a particular setup to be performed which contains different components.

## FLOTATION
Flotation is a process in Liquid-Solid Separation technology whereby solids in suspension are recovered by their attachment to gas (usually air) bubbles usually with objective of removing the solids from the liquid. The particles most effectively removed are in the size range from 10 to 200 μm. The particle-bubble aggregates that are formed have a density less than the suspension itself

## Flotation froth 
Flotation froth The process of froth flotation for the separation of minerals exploits the fact that either minerals differ naturally in their degree of wettability by surfactant solutions or their surface properties can be modified by adsorption. When air is blown through a suspension of finely ground ore in an appropriate surfactant solution those particles which have the relevant surface

How Froth Flotation was Discovered and Developed. ensp·enspFROM GRANULATION TO FLOTATION. The plant had now been running for a couple of months on tailings and slimes from various sources and during this time the frothing method was generally ousting the granulation process until finally the superiority of the spitzbox and froth method was clearly demonstrated.

Froth flotation definition is - flotation in which air bubbles are introduced into a mixture of finely divided ore or other material with water and a chemical that aids attachment of the bubbles to the particles of the desired material and its recovery as a froth.
