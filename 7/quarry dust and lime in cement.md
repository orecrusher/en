## Flexural and Split Tensile Strength Properties of Lime 
Similarly tensile strengths were 2.91N/mm 2 for 50% laterite: 50% quarry dust and 1.67N/mm 2 for 25% laterite: 75% quarry dust. These indied that both flexural and tensile strengths increase with increase in laterite content. The results suggested that concrete containing mixtures of lateritic sand and quarry dust can be reasonably used
