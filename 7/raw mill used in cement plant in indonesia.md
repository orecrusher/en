The raw mix is fed into a circular storage unit called a raw mix storage. Then the mix is extracted transversely from the stockpile by reclaimers and conveyed to a raw mill bin called the raw mix bin for grinding. The other raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing called additives are high purity limestone sand and iron ore.

## Cement Grinding Aids 
Cement Raw Mill Grinding Aid (RM-GA) act to improve the specific surface and grind-ability index of the material ground. That is attributed to the additive's ability to reduce resistance to comminution and to prevent agglomeration of the freshly ground particles (due to neutralization of static charges) and powder coating on the grinding media (balls) and mill liners.
