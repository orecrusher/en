Coal is mined either by surface methods (open-cut or open-cast mining) or by underground techniques. In surface mining all of the rock from the ground surface to the top of the seam (material referred to as overburden) is removed and set aside to expose the coal which is then taken out and transported from the mine for preparation and use ( Figure 11 ).

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of underground 
 · Economically a better option in some geological settings but human safety a major issue. Shallow mineral or coal deposits can be economically mined by open-pit or strip mines. However with deeper mineral or coal deposits it becomes very costly to remove a great deal of overburden in these kinds of settings. So in these cases underground mining is more cost effective.
