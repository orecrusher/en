 · The study compares the distribution of both mineralogical and elemental analyses of Huntly North bauxites with bauxite from other operating minesites. Report includes results of a small supplementary project carried out to address the deficiency in our knowledge of the mineralogy and chemistry of Darling Range bauxite and to establish the forms of aluminium (AI) in pisolitic bauxite.

The project is being developed in two phases with the first phase involving an investment of $1.4bn. The $4bn second phase involves the construction of an alumina refinery. The first phase is expected to produce 12 million tons per annum (Mtpa) of export-quality bauxite ore starting from mid-2019. It is estimated to have a mine life of 20 years.

## Bauxite 
Most bauxite mines produce Direct Shipping Ore (DSO) bauxite as they require no processing before being sent to a refinery. However some bauxites require some form of screening (either wet or dry) to remove the fine grained material to improve the grade and/or handleability.

## Bauxite Ore S Processing To Alumina Projects
Bauxite Ore S Processing To Alumina Projects. Australia has large deposits of bauxite and is the world's largest producer and exporter of bauxite. Australia is the world's 2nd largest exporter of alumina and 4th largest for aluminum. Bauxite is a naturally-occurring ore from which alumina is refined and then smelted to produce aluminium.

Answer is : (4) SiO 2. In bauxite impurities of Fe 2 O 3 TiO 2 and SiO 2 are present Fe2O 3 and TiO 2 are basic oxides therefore does not reacts with or dissolve in NaOH whereas SiO 2 is acidic oxide it gets dissolve in NaOH hence leach outSiO 2 + 2NaOH → Na 2 SiO 3 (aq.) + H 2 O
