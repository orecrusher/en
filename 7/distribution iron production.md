## How do you even set up good iron distribution : factorio
Your problem sounds like it's Iron production not distribution. Produce more Iron plates and all the production spots which need Iron plates will have what they need. Spending time thinking about how to evenly distribute your not-enough resources is not as fruitful as spending time increasing your production of those resources.

Steel is produced through a variety of ways using iron ore and various types of scrap metals. Through the steel making process impurities are removed from the iron such as silicon nitrogen phosphorus sulfur and carbon. Differing elements like manganese nickel and chromium are then added to the iron to create a wide range of steel products.
