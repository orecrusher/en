## Draught Fans Used in Thermal Power Plants 
Coal-fired thermal power plants systems use several types of process fans. In power plants the PA fans supply air for conveying of the pulverized coal from coal mills to the furnace area. These primary air fans produce a high pressure to push the coal and air mixture through pulverizer into the furnace.
