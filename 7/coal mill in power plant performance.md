 · Trona (sodium sesquicarbonate) a dry sorbent powder used for flue gas desulfurization in coal-fired power plants is semi-abrasive and hygroscopic. In one power plant the material was to be ground 24/7 in a pin mill for direct injection into the plant's flue stream where the finely ground trona particles would absorb contaminants in the flue gas to mitigate air pollution.
