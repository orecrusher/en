## 11.19.1 Sand And Gravel Processing
Industrial sand and gravel typically are mined from open pits of naturally occurring quartz-richsand and sandstone. Mining methods depend primarily on the degree of cementation of the rock. Insome deposits blasting is required to loosen the material prior to processing. The material mayundergo primary crushing at the mine site before being transported to the processing plant.Figure 11.19.1-2 is a flow diagram for industrial sand and gravel processing.
