Dry aggregate contains 33 to 34% air voids whereas sand contains 20% air voids and cement contains very fine particles hence it contains negligible are voids so we can ignore it. Now add the air voids of sand and aggregate that are 20% +34% = 54% so this is the reason we have to add 54% for wet to dry volume of materials.
