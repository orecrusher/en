## Ball mill media optimization 
mill grinding rate over the material's grindability as measured in the lab. Mill percent solids optimization has thusly been achieved (McIvor et al. 2000). For media sizing maximizing the mill grinding rate on a given ore is equivalent to maximizing the mill grinding efficiency. Ores of different grindability will be part of the discussion.
