## The Working Principle of Raymond Mill 
 · The Working Principle of Raymond Mill. When the vertical roller mill works the materials to be crushed are added into the machine from the feeding hopper on the side of the machine cover shell. It relies on a roller-grinding device suspended on the main frame to rotate around a vertical axis while rotating itself.

 · Wind turbines work on a simple principle: instead of using electricity to make wind—like a fan—wind turbines use wind to make electricity. Wind turns the propeller-like blades of a turbine around a rotor which spins a generator which creates electricity. Wind is a form of solar energy caused by a combination of three concurrent events:

On Vertical Mills the 4th Axis is frequently parallel to X or Y and is laid down. On a Horizontal Mill the 4th Axis is also parallel to X or Y but it is standing up. Both methods work great but the horizontal mill's standing 4th axis frequently has more clearance available since the work is never trapped between the table and the axis.

Third was the geared mill driven by a vertical waterwheel with a horizontal shaft. This required more knowledge and engineering skill than the first two but it had much greater potential. Vertical waterwheels were also distinguished by the loion of water contact with the wheel: first the undershot wheel ; second the breast wheel ; and third the overshot wheel .

¾Although vertical axis wind turbines have these advantages their designs are not as efficient at collecting energy from the wind as are the horizontal machine designs. ¾There is one more type of wind-mill called Cyclo-gyro wind-mill with very high efficiency of about 60%. However it is not very stable and is very sensitive to wind direction.
