 · Secondary storage is named as such because it doesn't have direct access to the CPU. As a result it is considerably slower than primary storage. Luckily it compensates for that lack of speed in several ways. Aside from offering greater data retention secondary storage is usually twice as cheap compared to its primary counterpart.

## Difference between Spatial and Temporal Data Mining 
 · Temporal data mining; 1. It requires space. It requires time. 2. Spatial mining is the extraction of knowledge/spatial relationship and interesting measures that are not explicitly stored in spatial database. Temporal mining is the extraction of knowledge about occurrence of an event whether they follow Cyclic Random Seasonal variations etc. 3.

 · 'Save' is a positive primary action button When a Primary Action is Negative ('Replace' or 'Delete' ) In this case giving the button which stands for irreversible action more visual weight is dangerous because the user can select the irreversible action by mistake.For example when it comes to replacing a file it's fine that a user takes an extra second to think about the action.

## What is NGS? 
The output of primary analysis is files containing base calls assembled into sequencing reads (FASTQ files) and their associated quality scores (Phred quality score). Secondary analysis involves read filtering and trimming based on quality followed by alignment of reads to a reference genome or assembly of reads for novel genomes and finally by variant calling.
