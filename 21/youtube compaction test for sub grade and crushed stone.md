## When To Use Crushed Stone As Opposed To Gravel For A Project
Crushed stone is a versatile material and can also be used for many commercial residential and DIY projects. Due to its modest cost and easy installation it is often used for horse riding arenas (screenings) and walking and bike paths (screenings and 3/8" size) as well as for drainage systems and as a base or sub-base for residential crushed rock driveways and retaining walls.

## Granular Sub Base Construction And Quality Control 
Granular Sub Base is a layer in road foundation just above the compacted sub-grade layer. GSB or granular sub-base prevents capillary water from rising; its particle size is so designed that the capillary action stops and cant go beyond GSB layer. Secondly it works like a drainage layer where water can pass without damaging other road layers.
