## What metals are extracted using a blast furnace?
 · The blast furnace Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

## Iron Extraction Manufacturing Process 
Iron Extraction Manufacturing Process - Blast Furnace Method. Iron is extracted from different ores exist in the world. Hematite (Fe 2 O 3) is reduced to iron metal in the blast furnace under several steps. Limestone and coke are used as other raw materials to generate heat and reducing agents.

## Write down the reactions taking place in different zones 
In blast furnace iron oxides are reduced at different temperature ranges. In the lower part of the blast furnace the temperature is as high as 2 2 0 0 K. It is called combustion zone. At the top the temperature is as low as 5 0 0 − 8 0 0 K. It is called reduction zone.

## extraction of iron from blast furnace slag
Extraction Of Iron From Blast Furnace Slag. The slag is in molten state and separates out from iron the iron obtained from blast furnace contains about 4 carbon and some other impurities this iron is known as pig iron cast iron is different from pig iron and is made by melting pig iron with scrap iron and coke using hot air blast it has slightly lower carbon content about 3 and.

## A Review on Recycling and Reutilization of Blast Furnace 
 · A large amount of dust is formed as one of the primary by-products during the blast furnace ironmaking process. Besides iron and carbon it contains a variety of valuable metals such as zinc lead and indium widely applied in many industry fields. However it is difficult to recycle and reutilize blast furnace dust (BFD) due to complex composition fine particle size and strong hydrophobic

## Extraction of Iron (examples answers activities 
In the blast furnace it is so hot that carbon monoxide can be used to reduce the iron oxide in place of carbon: iron oxide + carbon monoxide → iron + carbon dioxide Fe 2 O 3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO 2. Iron from the blast furnace is an alloy of about 96 per cent iron with carbon and some other impurities. It is hard but too brittle for most uses
