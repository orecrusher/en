## Stamp mill 
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron-shod wood in some cases) stamps loosely held vertically in a frame in which the stamps can slide up and down. They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp the stamp falls onto the ore below crushing the rock and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.

 · GPU mining isn't as efficient as the ASIC one (although the hash rate can still be high) and is on average more expensive. However it gives miners flexibility allowing them to mine different coins using the same hardware device. Additionally GPU miners can also be used for non-mining activities and are something that many people already own.

Ball Mills Mine Engineer.Com provides mining goldBall Mills are generally used to grind material 1/4 inch and finer down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns. To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills they must be operated in a closed system with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.

## The Influence of Liner Wear on Milling Efficiency
The survey data was modelled in JKSimMet to provide direct comparisons of mill performance. This potentially provides a methodology for the design of liners that maintain a favourable shape for the majority of liner life yielding desirable production parameters such as lower specific energy consumption and higher throughput while at the same time maintaining practical liner life cycles.

## Large Ball Mill Scale
Ball mills 5.5 m (18 ft) in diameter and larger tend to use energy delivered to the mill less efficiently than smaller diameter mills particularly when the large mills carry 40% by volume ball charges. This paper will explore factors used in scaling up ball mills showing where the advantages of one factor can possibly be negated by another factor.
