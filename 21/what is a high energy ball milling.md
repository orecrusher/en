Milling was then performed in 80% ethanol for 30–120 minutes using a high-energy ball mill. The mechanical treatment resulted in a reduction of the fibre length and diameter probably due to degradation of the cellulose amorphous regions. Fibrillation was helped by the wet environment which facilitated the intra-fibre swelling.

The High Energy Ball Mill Emax and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input. The innovative design of both the mills and the grinding jars allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time - with only minor warming effects. These ball mills are also suitable for mechano chemistry.

## High energy ball milling and supercritical carbon dioxide 
 · The MDSC results show that high energy ball milling is capable of forcing the mixing of TD and SL at a molecular level providing a homogeneous amorphous solid solution. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) determined for the co-milled formulations range from 79°C to 139°C and they are higher than Tg of pure SL (ca. 70°C) and lower than Tg of pure TD (ca. 149°C).

## Preparation of Nb 3 Al by high
The A15 phase superconductor Nb 3 Al has been considered as an alternative to Nb 3 Sn for high field and large scale appliions. However to prepare a stoichiometric Nb 3 Al with fine grain structures is very difficult. High-energy ball milling is a solid state powder processing technique and is a very useful for preparing Nb-Al alloys (Nb3Al).
