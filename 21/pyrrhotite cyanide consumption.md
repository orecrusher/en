Cyanide consumption was studied to determine whether increased oxidation of the ore would result in excessive degradation of sodium cyanide or otherwise impact the level of gold extraction. X-Ray Diffraction analysis was conducted on untreated samples as well as the final residues from the end of select tests to investigate by-products that precipitated after oxidation.

The cyanide then dissolves gold and silver from the ore and forms a stable metal-cyanide complex. The use of oxygen or peroxygen compounds instead of air as an oxidant increases the leach rate and decreases cyanide consumption due to the inactivation of some of the cyanide consuming species present in the slurry.

## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching – An Introduction 
 · The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching – An Introduction. Leaching gold with a cyanide solution remains the most widely used hydrometallurgical process for the extraction of gold from ores and concentrates. Despite the difficulties and hazards of working with cyanide no other process has yet been proven to be an economic viable alternative.

## Modeling the Cyanide Consumption in Leaching of Gold Ores 
High cyanide consumption during the processing of gold ores with high sulphide minerals can make the typical cyanidation uneconomic. Also cyanide is a toxic material and environmental concerns of cyanide compounds are serious.

## Geometallurgical Approach for Impliions of Ore Blending 
 · The presence of minerals such as pyrrhotite (especially magnetic pyrrhotite) has adverse effects (i.e. excessive oxygen consumption) on gold recovery during cyanidation. The higher content of sulfide minerals may suggest that some of the gold occurs within them (either as impurity or discrete grains) as supported by petrography and QEMSCAN results (Vaughan 2004 ).

 · The usage of cyanide pills in history. We've all seen a scene in a movie when a captured spy swallows a pill to commit a suicide to prevent torture and the extraction of important information. These heroic acts of bravery are depicted in many spy movies but there are also real cases where people have used a pill to take their life.

In this paper the role of grinding media type on cyanide-based gold leaching in the presence of pyrrhotite was investigated. Pyrrhotite commonly occurs in many gold ores together with pyrite and/or arsenopyrite. A synthetic ore was prepared by mixing pyrrhotite with gravity gold concentrate and quartz.
