Copper processing example A high pH is important in the processing of copper ore to maximize this mineral's floatation properties. Most copper ore slurries tend to be acidic. Plants typically add lime to the slurry in the mill or floatation circuit increasing its alkalinity. A typical copper operation contains many floatation cells often

 · The flotation process which was responsible for the almost complete change in equipment has also undergone marked changes since its introduction in large-capacity concentrators. Flotation when first introduced between 1913 and 1916 was used primarily to reduce losses of copper in the fine tailings of gravity plants.
