## Gravity Separation 
Gravity separation has been applied to process chrome slag by steel researchers in India. Heavy media separation (Choudhury et al. 1996) and crushing and jigging (Khan et al. 2001) are the principal techniques used. The slag is subjected to 2-stage crushing to reduce the size to −10 mm and then screened into −10 +1 mm and −1 mm fractions.

If the ore product contains a combination of coarse and fine free gold the modular Gravity Flotation Intensive Leach (GFIL) system can produce a higher-yield product. For ores smaller than 50 micron the particle weight is too light for physical separation by gravity; therefore gold recovery will require a modular chemical flotation process.
