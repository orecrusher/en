## Palm Oil Refinery and Fractionation
Palm oil products are made using milling and refining processes: first using fractionation with crystallization and separation processes to obtain solid (stearin) and liquid (olein) fractions. Then melting and degumming removes impurities. Then the oil is filtered and bleached. Next physical refining removes smells and coloration.

 · Other process used for a long time is the Wohlwill Process and is considered as the second part of the Miller process due to refine its product. This is an electrolytic process based on the dissolution of gold in an acid bath prepared with chlorine gas and hydrochloric acid. The final product is a gold hode with 99.99% purity.
