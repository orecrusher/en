 · Typical power consumption for a 5-m diameter by 7-m-long ball mill is between 2.5 and 3.5 MW. The actual proportion of this energy usefully used in size reduction is thought to be very low perhaps in the range of 1–5%. Significant financial and environmental benefits can be obtained by improving this efficiency even slightly.
