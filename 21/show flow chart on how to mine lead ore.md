After mining finishes the mine area must undergo rehabilitation. Waste dumps are contoured to flatten them out to further stabilise them. If the ore contains sulfides it is usually covered with a layer of clay to prevent access of rain and oxygen from the air which can oxidise the sulfides to produce sulfuric acid a phenomenon known as acid mine drainage.
