Radioactive iodine and some other radioisotopes used in Nuclear Medicine are produced during the production of nuclear energy. They are a by-product or if you like a useful waste product. Every batch is rigorously tested to ensure its safety.

## Iodine Treatments for Radiation Exposure 
 · Stable iodine is an important chemical needed by the body to make thyroid hormones. Following a radiological or nuclear event radioactive iodine may be released into the air and then breathed into the lungs of any being breathing that air. Radioactive iodine may also contaminate the local food supply and get into the body through food or drink.

N2 - Background and aimsInternational guidelines on the treatment of differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC) promote the use of low iodine diets (LID) prior to radioactive iodine remnant ablation (RIA) as high iodine status may interfere with radioiodine uptake. Most UK treatment centres adhere to these guidelines and advise people to consume a LID.

Radioactive iodine therapy cannot be used to treat anaplastic (undifferentiated) and medullary thyroid carcinomas because these types of cancer do not take up iodine. Preparing for RAI therapy. For RAI therapy to be most effective you must have a high level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH or thyrotropin) in the blood.

This radioactive iodine will affect all thyroid cells no matter where in the body they are loed but will not damage normal tissue. These features make radioactive iodine a good treatment for thyroid cancer because the Iodine-131 will damage the cancerous cells and prevent the cancer from growing without affecting other cells in the body.

Radioactive Iodine I-131 (also called Radioiodine I-131) therapy is a treatment for an overactive thyroid a condition called hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism can be caused by Graves' disease in which the entire thyroid gland is overactive or by nodules within the gland which are locally overactive in producing too much thyroid hormone.
