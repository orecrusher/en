## Carbon Footprint Estimation in Road Construction: La 
determined that the construction of the hot mix asphalt (HMA) layer generates a carbon footprint of 65.8 kg of CO2e per km of road. In addition it was evident that HMA production generates the greatest environmental impact among all the considered LCA production and construction stages with a GHG contribution of 38% to 39% from bitumen only.
