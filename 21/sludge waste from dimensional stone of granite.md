## Characterization of Dimension Stone Sawing Sludge in Egypt
The marble sludge was found to mainly compose of calcium carbonate whereas the granite sludge varies in composition according to the mineralogy of the parent stone processed. The mineralogical and chemical characteristics of the dimension stone sludge are important factors in the determination of the most appropriate recycling options of this waste into different appliions.
