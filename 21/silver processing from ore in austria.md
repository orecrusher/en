Garpenberg (Fig. 17) is considered the most productive zinc underground mine in the world. In 2017 the mine output was 2.63 Mta of ore with lead copper gold and silver being produced in addition to zinc. The Tara Mine in Ireland is Europe's largest zinc mine. The ore is extracted there from a depth of about 1000 m (Fig. 18).

## silver ore processing techniques 
Silver is rarely found alone but mostly in ores which also contain lead copper gold and other metals which may be commercially valuable. Silver emerges as a byproduct of processing these metals. To recover silver from zinc-bearing ores the Parkes process is used. In this method the ore is heated until it becomes molten.

The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.

## Copper Concentrates 
The process of liberation of copper ores depends upon whether they are oxide or sulfide ores. Subsequent steps depend on the nature of the ore containing the copper. For oxide ores a hydrometallurgical liberation process is normally undertaken which uses the soluble nature of the ore minerals to the advantage of the metallurgical treatment plant.

 · Quality of Ores fit for the Solving Process. There is no process so suitable for all kinds of ores as the solving process. Generally considered all silver ores can be treated by the solving process which are subjected to the pan amalgamation after roasting ; but in many instances— especially with the rebellious ores— a better result is obtained by this than by working in pans.
