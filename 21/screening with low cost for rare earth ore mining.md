 · All the world's lithium cobalt rare earths industrial diamonds and uranium put together earn less revenue than Rio Tinto gets from just its Australian iron ore mines. No wonder that mining companies are spending such vast sums on copper and aluminum — the two nonferrous metals with the scale and price to measure up to iron ore gold and fossil fuels.

 · Rare earth elements are much more important than they were 30 years ago and are indispensible in technologies such as smartphones wind turbines and hybrid cars. "Other changes have only recently started developing; for example the expansion of the world's electric car fleet promises to greatly increase the need for lithium.

## Mining 
Mining is the extraction of minerals and elements of economic interest from the earth's surface. As the demand for natural resources increases the amount of material in mineral deposits decreases. An increase in price of these materials allows companies to continue to profit from mining deposits with lower ore grades.

## China's ion
 · Rare earth ore deposits have relatively low concentrations ranging from 10 to a few hundred parts per million by weight making them difficult to mine economically. Bastnaesite (with a formula of (CeLa)CO 3 (FOH)) and monazite (with a formula of (CeLaNdTh)PO 4) ores are far more complied and costly to extract than ion-adsorption clays.

## Lithium Mining: The Hidden Environmental Cost of EVs 
 · There will also be an enormous complex to extract lithium from the mined ore for its conversion into a non-volatile carbonate form to be made into batteries. Because lithium's concentration in ore at Thacker Pass runs as low as two-tenths of one percent producing one ton of the stuff for use by society entails strip mining and processing as much as 500 tons of earth.
