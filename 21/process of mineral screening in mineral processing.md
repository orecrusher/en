## Mechanical screening 
Mechanical screening often just called screening is the practice of taking granulated ore material and separating it into multiple grades by particle size.. This practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and mineral processing agriculture pharmaceutical food plastics and recycling.. A method of separating solid particles according to size alone is called screening.

## Crushing in Mineral Processing
 · In mineral processing or metallurgy the first stage of comminution is crushing.. Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate/surface.

## Particle Analysis in Mining and Minerals 
Many of the particles encountered in mining are characterized by sieves (classifiers). Recent advances in computers cameras and software make image analysis practical for samples with sizes larger than several microns in diameter. As particle size decreases sieving and/or dynamic image analysis becomes more arduous or impossible and laser diffraction becomes the technique of choice.
