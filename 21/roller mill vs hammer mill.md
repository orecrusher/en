## Distillery milling efficiency 
 · Hammer mills eliminate the need to screen product. However when you fine-grind with a hammer mill it may take more power per ton and maintenance costs may be higher compared to roller mills. Master distillers should also consider that they could overgrind or create too many fines.

## Hammermills versus roller mills 
Roller mills simply "roll" or "crush" product between two revolving cylinders. This latter process has the distinct advantage of requiring considerably less power although it is not possible to achieve the fineness of final grind through a roller mill that can be achieved through a hammermill. In a hammermill the screen-hole diameter controls the maximum finished particle size of any ground product.

## COMPARISON OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY BETWEEN A ROLLER MILL 
AIt is generally believed that roller mills utilize energy more efficiently than hammer mills (Silver 1931; Puckett and Daum 1968; Appel 1987). To verify this a completely randomized factorial experimental design (CRD) with two repliions was constructed: a total of 72 grinding tests was conducted to compare the energy efficiency between a roller mill and a hammer mill.
