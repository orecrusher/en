## Concrete Mix Ratio and How to Mix Concrete Including a 
Concrete is a mixture of cement sand (fine aggregate) small stone or gravel (coarse aggregate) and water. It has many appliions from fence posts to motorway bases and because of this there are many different concrete mix ratios that the constituents can be mixed to with each resulting in a different strength of concrete.
