Compressive Strength of Concrete. The compressive strength of concrete is a measure of the concrete's ability to resist forces trying to compress or push the concrete together. Concrete is very strong in compression particularly in comparison to the concrete's strength in tension and flexure which are relatively weak.

Strength of concrete The compressive strength of concrete is measured by how much force is required to crush it this is important in the design of structures. In pavements and other slabs on the ground the design is usually based on flexural strength (i.e.; how much force the concrete can withstand in bending before it breaks).
