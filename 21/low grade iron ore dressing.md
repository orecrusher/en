## Iron Ore Analysis Process Optimization Solutions 
Decreasing ore grades of existing or new iron ore deposits require predictive solutions to efficiently sort and blend iron ore for optimal and profitable beneficiation and downstream processing. Elemental and mineralogical composition as well as predictive models for the upgradability based on metallurgical parameters such as washable constituents play an important role for iron ore producers.

## Estimating the lump to fines composition split in iron ore 
Iron ore is mined crushed and separated into lump and fines components which are sold as separate products. Quality (and therefore value) depends upon the shipped composition of each product matching a target composition vector in iron and in several other minerals. Each day ore is selected for mining to meet these target grades.

 · An ore that is self-fluxing may be of lower grade for direct smelting than one that requires the addition of a large amount of barren flux. On the other hand a low-grade ore sometimes may be profitably mined and shipped direct because it is high in silica iron or lime or some other fluxing material required by the smelter.
