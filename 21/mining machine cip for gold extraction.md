of gold production should focus on these two stages. Mining and comminution are highly dependent on the grade of gold ore as the lower the grade the greater the amount that needs to be mined and the more crushing and grinding is required to extract the gold from the ore.

 · Strip mining is done only when the ore body is in close proximity to the surface. Open-pit mining – Open-pit mining is the method in which minerals or rocks are extracted from the Earth via an open pit or borrow. Mountaintop removal mining – Mountaintop removal mining (MTR) is done by mining coal seams underneath mountaintops.

## Extracting Gold 
Removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.
