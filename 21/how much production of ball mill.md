From the AG mills the ore travels to the primary magnetic separators where the iron is drawn away from the waste material before it's screened and fed into the ball mills.

In particular an increase in the yield from 17.45% to 43.06% and in the DS values was observed when the duration of milling was brought from 1 to 2 hours. This was explained with the action of the ball mill on the inter- and intra- molecular hydrogen bonds which were cleaved leading to a higher number of hydroxyl groups available to react.

Ball size distribution is governed by the wear law of the mill and by the wear characteristics through the cross-section of the balls charged to the mill. With this in mind it is interesting to make a qualitative comparison of the ball size distributions which should be generated by 76 mm pearlitic carbon steel balls versus 76 mm martensitic alloy steel balls in the 2.93 m mills.

Ball mills are large porcelain lined rotating drums containing golf ball sized porcelain balls. Rolling and tumbling of the balls provides sufficient force to break up agglomerates. Bead mills are used for large batches and can maintain semi-continuous output. Operation is similar to a ball mill but the vessel is smaller and balls are 3mm
