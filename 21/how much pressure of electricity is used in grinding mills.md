Mills usually operate in the range 65 - 82% of critical but values as high as 90% are sometimes used. A crucial parameter that defines the performance of a mill is the energy consumption. The power supplied to the mill is used primarily to lift the load (medium and charge). Additional power is required to keep the mill rotating. 8.1.3 Power

The Operating Principal. P ulverization takes place in the central chamber of the Micron-Master® jet energy mill as the process material is driven at near sonic velocity around the perimeter of the toroidal chamber by multiple jets of air or steam. No grinding media is involved. Size reduction is the result of the high-velocity collisions between particles of the process material itself.

Another egory of grain mills is flakers. Most often used to make fresh oatmeal from oat groats (oats with the hull removed) flakers create a flake that's thicker and chewier than the paper-thin flakes available in grocery stores. Because flaking grain requires much less energy than grinding flour most flakers are manual.

 · A windmill is a mill that turns the kinetic energy of the wind into a rotational energy using sails or blades. Initially windmills were used to grind cereals and turn them into flour or to pump water. Today we are using wind turbines (uses only three blades instead of four) to turn the kinetic power of the wind into clean electricity.
