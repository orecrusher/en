## What is the eccentric throw? — SRP 
The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber – it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action.
