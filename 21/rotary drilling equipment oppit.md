## Rotary drilling 
Rotary drilling. Rotary drilling is used to form a deep observation borehole or for obtaining representative samples of rock. The drilling method involves a powered rotary cutting head on the end of a shaft driven into the ground as it rotates. The system requires lubriion (air water or drilling mud) to keep the cutting head cool.
