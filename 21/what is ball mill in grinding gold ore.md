## Why gold mines are adopting HPGRs to 
 · For gold mines using carbon-in-leach (CIL) processes for recovery we've found the best results are achieved with a HPGR performing tertiary grinding before a ball mill further reduces the product. In this role the HPGR significantly uplifts the capacity of the circuit and provides flexibility both in dealing with feeds that a ball mill would struggle with and the product quality required

Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.
