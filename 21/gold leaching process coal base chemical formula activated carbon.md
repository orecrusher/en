## Extracting Gold 
Leaching dissolves the gold out of the ore using a chemical solvent. The most common solvent is cyanide which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon-in-pulp. As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically gold in the pulp dissolves. When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank the gold adheres to the carbon.

 · Decontaminate the resulting gold. This is harder than it sounds because you can't separate out non-radioactive gold from radioactive gold using purely chemical methods. It should be obvious from this process that it currently costs much more money to create non-radioactive gold than you could ever earn by selling the gold.

## Activated Carbon in Gold Cyanidation
The gold cyanidation process is a primary method of gold beneficiation. Activated carbon is a critical component in the beneficiation of gold ore allowing this widespread process to occur because of its ability to recover gold from the gold-cyanide complex. Depending on the deposit some silver ores may also be processed via cyanidation.

It is used in water filters medicines that selectively remove toxins and chemical purifiion processes. Activated charcoal is carbon that has been treated with oxygen. The treatment results in highly porous charcoal.

In this process active carbon is the solid. Activated carbon is produced specifically so as to achieve a very big internal surface (between 500 - 1500 m 2 /g). This big internal surface makes active carbon ideal for adsorption. Active carbon comes in two variations: Powder Activated Carbon (PAC) and Granular Activated Carbon (GAC).
