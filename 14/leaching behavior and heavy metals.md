## The Evaluation of the Heavy Metal Leaching Behavior of 
The AAMs brick with the addition of GFFA and FBFA has an alkali activation system to encapsulate heavy metals. By comparing the results obtained from the CEN/TS 14429 leaching behavior test and the four batch leaching tests it was found that the most influential factors for the heavy metal leaching concentration are whether the heavy metal has been solidified/stabilized in the samples.

Abstract: An investigation was conducted on the characteristics and leaching behavior of heavy metals from municipal solid wastes incineration (MSWI) fly ash in Chongqing China. Results indied that the average particle size of the fly ash was 36.4 μm the large particles were formed mainly by small particles' adsorption or aggregation.

## Strength and leaching behavior of heavy metal contaminated 
 · Conventional toxicity leaching test such as TCLP is usually used to analyze the leaching concentration of heavy metals (U.S.E.P.A. 1995). However it is not feasible to only use TCLP method to evaluate the long term leaching behavior and stability of heavy metals under unfavorable factors conditions (China Environmental Science Press 2007).

## Leaching Behavior of Metals and Sulfate from Taconite 
 · Taconite tailings may leach heavy and toxic metals which could contaminate the soil surface and groundwater. Coarse sand fine and composite sized taconite tailings were subjected to pH-dependent leaching tests in the pH range of 2 to 13 to investigate the leaching behavior of aluminum (Al) chromium (Cr) magnesium (Mg) and sulfate (SO 4).

Generally speaking leached heavy metals from fly ash slurries are more than those from the fly ashes solidified at OMC. But there are exceptions e.g. less Cr was observed in the leachates of slurries with cement addition.

heavy metals. Adsorptions of all the metals are higher at lower pH value 3 in comparison to that of 5. This implies that metals will be retarded more in the clay barrier in the case of leachate of lower pH. This might be due to precipitation of heavy metals in more acidic environment.

Leaching behavior of heavy metal elements from Sn-3.5 Ag-0.5 Cu Sn-3.5 Ag Sn-0.5 Cu lead-free solders and their joints were investigated in typical acid alkaline and saline corrosion solutions. It is found that for solder alloys significant leaching of Sn was observed in NaCl saline solution about two orders of magnitude higher than that in acid and alkaline solution.
