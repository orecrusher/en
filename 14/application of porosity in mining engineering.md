## Porosity 
 · Porosity decreases with increasing net overburden pressure (lithostatic pressure minus pore pressure) and in clastic rocks stress sensitivity generally increases with increasing clay and decreasing cement content. Because porosity is stress dependent laboratory measurements should be made at stress conditions whenever possible.

## Porosity for resource in place calculations 
 · Importance of porosity calculation. The porosity and its distribution also need to be calculated as accurately as possible because they are almost always directly used in the water saturation (S w) and permeability calculations and possibly in the net pay calculations. In most OOIP and OGIP studies only the gross-rock-volume uncertainties have a greater influence on the result than porosity
