## How to Determine the Aggregate Crushing Strength Value in 
 · In road construction the quality of aggregates is assessed by the crushing strength of aggregates.For higher quality of roads the aggregate should possess low aggregate crushing value. Here I am going to teach you how to determine the crushing strength of aggregates.First let us check what are the various apparatus needed for this experiment.

Procedure of Impact Test. The procedure of the impact value test includes the following series of steps: 1. The aggregate samples of size 10mm to 12.5mm (passing through 12.5mm sieve and retained on 10mm sieve) are first taken and oven-dried at a temperature ranging from 100 degree Celsius to 110 degree Celsius for about four hours.

## Crushing Value Test of Aggregate 
 · The 'aggregate crushing value' gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. With aggregate of 'aggregate crushing value' 30 or higher the result may be anomalous and in such cases the 'ten percent fines value' should be determined instead.

 · The aggregate crushing value test evaluates the ability of the aggregates used in road or pavement construction to withstand the stresses induced by moving vehicles in the form of crushing. With this the aggregates should also provide sufficient resistance to crushing under the roller during construction work and under rigid tyre rims of heavily loaded animals or men drawn vehicles.
