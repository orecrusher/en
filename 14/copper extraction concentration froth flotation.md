## The Appliion of Froth Flotation Technology to Copper in 
 · The 'copper problem' related to the poor recovery of fine copper sulphide particles that were not amenable to gravity methods. The success of flotation led to changes in both the scale and methods of mining concentration and smelting in a manner that allowed integrated mining companies to flourish. Many are still with us today.

## COPPER Copper production 
About 80 % of primary copper production comes from low-grade or poor sulfide ores. After enrichment steps the copper concentrates are usually treated by pyrometallurgical methods. Generally copper extraction follows the sequence (see Figure below): 1. Beneficiation by froth flotation of ore to give copper concentrate

 · Froth flotation is a physicochemical process that has been used for more than a century in the concentration of copper sulfide mineralsThis process is based on the wettability of copper mineral particles to recover the mineral species of interest and depress unwanted gangue. A very important aspect of flotation is its kinetics.
