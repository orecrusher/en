## How to measure viscosity :: Anton Paar Wiki
How the gravimetric flow principle works Take a capillary with precisely specified dimensions (inner diameter length) and an equally precise distance given by two marks. Let a known quantity of liquid flow through this capillary and measure the time the liquid level takes to travel from one mark to the other.

## Cone Crusher 
 · Cone crusher and gyratory crusher work on the same principle. Both have the same operation. If cone crusher differs then it is only from crushing chamber. Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles.

## Rheometer 
Cone and plate rheometers can also be operated in an oscillating mode to measure elastic properties or in combined rotational and oscillating modes. Types of extensional rheometer [ edit ] The development of extensional rheometers has proceeded more slowly than shear rheometers due to the challenges associated with generating a homogeneous extensional flow.
