## Bedrock Profiling 
In placer gold exploration and mining it is imperative to understand your bedrock depths and where gold is likely to be found. In almost every placer deposit the best gold is found in ancient river channels. Since the gold rush era numerous techniques have been used to find and understand the makeup of paleo-river channels.
