 · The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process. The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace. These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.
