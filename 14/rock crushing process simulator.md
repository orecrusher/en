## Crushing in Mineral Processing
 · In mineral processing or metallurgy the first stage of comminution is crushing.. Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate/surface.

## Nature of Rock Fragmentation Process in Crushing Operation 
 · Understanding fragmentation behaviour of rock under crushing process is fundamental to improved productivity and efficiency in mining operations. This is particularly so as all subsequent size reduction processes such as crushing and grinding are far more energy intensive than the initial blasting process employed in breaking of in situ rock.
