How Gold Works. Removing the goldbearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.

## How to Remove Copper from Silver 
Â Â· However it is not easy to find silver in its pure form. It is often found in metallic ores that contain quantities of other metals such as copper. To separate silver from an ore containing a quantity of copper you need to heat the ore sample to a level sufficient to melt the silver but leave the copper in a still-solid state.
