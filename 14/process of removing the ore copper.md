## How to Remove Copper from Silver 
 · However it is not easy to find silver in its pure form. It is often found in metallic ores that contain quantities of other metals such as copper. To separate silver from an ore containing a quantity of copper you need to heat the ore sample to a level sufficient to melt the silver but leave the copper in a still-solid state.
