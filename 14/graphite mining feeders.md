## Graphite Mining 
Graphite Mining. Pure graphite is a mineral form of the element carbon (element #6 symbol C). It forms as veins and disseminations in metamorphic rocks as the result of the metamorphism of organic material included in limestone deposits. It is an extremely soft mineral and it breaks into minute flexible flakes that easily slide over one another.
