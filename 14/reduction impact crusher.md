## Crusher Reduction Ratio 
 · Crusher Reduction Ratio. I have mentioned the fact that as the % of voids in the crushing chamber decreases the production of fines by attrition increases. This is like saying that as the Crusher Reduction Ratio in any given crusher is increased the % of fines in the product will increase even though the discharge setting remains unchanged.

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency 
 · Size reduction in an impact crusher relies on energy being conveyed into the rock from the rotor and it begins with your feed. The initial impact is responsible for more than 60 percent of the crushing action with the remainder made up of impact against an adjustable breaker bar and a small amount of inter-particle collision.

 · Size reduction in an impact crusher can not be modeled by single particle breakage phenomena because it accounts only for particle and the impeller collisions. A particle in an impact crusher collides not only with the impeller and the crusher walls but also with other particles. These particle-to-particle collisions are very weak in nature.
