## Mineral Exploration FOR THE LAYPERSON 
 · Mineral exploration is a long and varied road which in rare occurrence results in a mine. Mineral exploration starts with kicking over some rocks or even looking at maps and satellite pictures thousands of miles away from what is being explored. From there it moves through a number of stages of increased complexity and costs with the next step

When a mining company is interested in opening a new mine they begin with one of two steps. If the company already knows the ore content of a region (see loion of deposits page) they will begin sampling and conducting feasibility studies. However if they have no prior knowledge of a potential deposit they will begin mineral exploration.
