## Ball Mills – fritsch
Ball Mills are the most effective laboratory mills for rapid batchwise comminution of medium-hard soft brittle fibrous temperature-sensitive and moist samples down to the finest particle size. The comminution of the material to be ground takes place through impact and friction between the grinding balls and the inside wall of the grinding bowl respectively the mortar.

## High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis
For all nanocrystalline materials prepared by high-energy ball milling synthesis route surface and interface contamination is a major concern. In particular mechanical attributed contamination by the milling tools (Fe or WC) as well as ambient gas (trace impurities such as O 2 N 2 in rare gases) can be problems for high-energy ball milling.
