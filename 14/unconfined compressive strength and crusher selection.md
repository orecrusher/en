The natural sand is loose in structure with a small cohesive force. Organic polymer can be used to reinforce this sand. To assess the effectiveness of organic polymer as soil stabilizer (PSS) a series of unconfined compressive strength tests have been performed on reinforced sand. The focus of this study was to determine a curing method and a mix design to stabilize sand.

## Compressive strength 
The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence for this region = where this time E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.
