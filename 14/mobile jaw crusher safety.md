## Sample Preparation and Physical Testing 
Sample Crushing. SGS laboratory staff most commonly use a jaw crusher as the primary crushing tool. These crushers can accommodate chunks up to 15 cm and can reduce them in size until 80% of the sample passes through a 2 mm screen. Staff then use ring and puck mills to prepare a smaller particle size if required for sample pulverizing.
