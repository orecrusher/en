## Iron 
Iron has been known since ancient times. The origin of the chemical symbol Fe is from the Latin word 'ferrum' meaning iron. The first iron used by humans is likely to have been sourced from fallen meteorites. Most objects that fall to earth from space are stony but a small proportion are "iron meteorites" with iron contents of over 90 percent.

Cast iron is an iron alloy containing 2 wt.% – 4 wt.% carbon 1 wt.% – 3 wt.% silicon and smaller amounts of minor elements [1]. In comparison steel has a lower carbon content of up to 2 wt.% and a lower silicon content. Cast iron can also be further optimized by alloying with small quantities of manganese molybdenum cerium nickel copper vanadium and titanium before being cast.
