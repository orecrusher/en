## Cyanide hazards to plants and animals from gold mining and 
Cyanide extraction of gold through milling of high-grade ores and heap leaching of low-grade ores requires cycling of millions of liters of alkaline water containing high concentrations of potentially toxic sodium cyanide (NaCN) free cyanide and metal-cyanide complexes. Some milling operations result in tailings ponds of 150 ha and larger.
