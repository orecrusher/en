 · Commercial coke is generally made in one of two ways: (1) By-Product Coking and (2) Non-Recovery/Heat Recovery Coking. A majority of the coke produced in the United States comes from By-Product Coking where the coal is carbonized in large ovens and the off-gas is collected and processed to recover various carbon-based by-products such as napthalene benzene toluene and

Use of this zero-total effect was indied by practical experience gained from operating various coke oven batteries using various coal blends at different coking times. The estimated heat demand [ 2 ] for the coking process calculated on this zero-total effect assumption was practical because it incorporated sufficient excess to cover the heat demand in all stages of the coking process.

## Coking and High Temperature Carbonization Coke 
For carbonizing wet compressed charges of coal the ovens are designed to burn off in 16 to 18 hours and have a carbonizing capacity of up to io tons of coke per oven per day. The ovens are heated by the gas evolved from the coal during carbonization after it has passed through the condensing and scrubbing process incidental to the recovery of the by-products.
