## What is the power grid and how does it work? 
 · First you need electricity The power grid starts in the places where electricity is made. Electricity once was generated only at central power stations which usually ran on fossil fuels — coal or natural gas — or nuclear energy. Today more and cleaner options for energy generation are available. Those options can also cut costs.

## How a battery works 
 · A battery is a device that stores chemical energy and converts it to electrical energy. The chemical reactions in a battery involve the flow of electrons from one material (electrode) to another through an external circuit. The flow of electrons provides an electric current that can be used to do work. To balance the flow of electrons charged

## How do nuclear power plants work? 
Our ability to mine great amounts of energy from uranium nuclei has led some to bill nuclear power as a plentiful utopian source of electricity. But rather than dominate the global electricity market nuclear power has declined from a high of 18% in 1996 to 11% today. What happened to the great promise of this technology? M.V. Ramana and Sajan Saini detail the challenges of nuclear power.

## How do electricity transformers work? 
 · One important thing to note is that this trick works only if the electric current is fluctuating in some way. In other words you have to use a type of constantly reversing electricity called alternating current (AC) with a transformer. Transformers do not work with direct current (DC) where a steady current constantly flows in the same direction.

Pumped storage plants store energy using a system of two interconnected reservoirs with one at a higher elevation than the other.
