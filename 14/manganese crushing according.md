Austenitic manganese steel – steel alloyed with more than 10% manganese – is work-hardening. That means that high impacts – like those in a crushing chamber for example – cause the formation of a extremely hard surface layer that is two to three times harder than the rest of the alloy If impacted enough this results in a hard exterior layer backed by a softer core.
