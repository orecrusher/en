Bromine tablets also have less of an odour as the strong scent of Chlorine although chlorine scents only become strong in the dirty water. The main disadvantages of bromine is that is very slow to dissolve in comparison to Chlorine and especially in hard water areas Also Bromine is also more expensive to buy in comparison to chlorine with a difference of cost from around 30% or more.

## Evidence that stratospheric ozone is destroyed by chlorine 
Similar reactions involving chlorine and bromine have also been shown to occur during winter and spring in the Arctic polar regions which leads to some chemical depletion of ozone in that region. Because the Arctic is not usually as persistently cold as the Antarctic fewer stratospheric clouds form and therefore there is less ozone depletion in the Arctic which is the subject of a later

## alkanes and cycloalkanes with chlorine or bromine
The reactions between alkanes and chlorine or bromine. There is no reaction in the dark. In the presence of a flame the reactions are rather like the fluorine one - producing a mixture of carbon and the hydrogen halide. The violence of the reaction drops considerably as you go from fluorine to chlorine to bromine.

## Difference Between Bromine and Chlorine 
Bromine is less reactive than chlorine. However under normal conditions bromine participates in multiple chemical interactions. Often in the chemical compounds bromine exhibits a -1 oxidation state but it can also be in any odd positive oxidation state (+1 +3 +5 +7). Chlorine can be present in all oxidation states from -1 to +7 except +2.

## Bromine as a disinfectant 
A bromine-containing stick was developed in 1958 because of the risks of using fluid bromine. This stick exists of bromine-chlorine-dimethylhydantoin (Dihalo DMH).Both chlorine and bromine are attached to a nitrogen atom which acts as an organic support. Applied to water DHM is hydrolyzed and forms hypochlorous acid.

 · Correspondingly can I use chlorine test strips for bromine? Yes you can use a pool test kit and extrapolate the bromine reading in a pool or spa. If you have a DPD test kit you need simply multiply the test result by 2.25 to obtain the bromine equivalency. This works because bromine is over twice as dense as chlorine..

## Bromine in Swimming Pools? 
Bromine is also a less powerful oxidizer than chlorine so when you're using it to break down bather waste in a pool it's not quite as effective as chlorine. Basically that means the homeowner or service pro must stay on top of things or he'll be buying oxidizer — either monopersulfate or chlorine shock — to eliminate waste buildup.

Bromine addition is thus more useful in systems that maintain higher pH levels. Similarly to chlorine bromine will react with ammonia and nitrogen to form bromamines. However bromamines are considerably more powerful disinfectants than the associated chloramines so additional bromine is not necessary to compensate as with chlorine.

So reduced chlorine/bromine and a LOT more metals. Copper does a very good job at killing algae but it's very poor at killing bacteria and Copper/Silver/Zinc do nothing for viruses. And you still must shock with chlorine or monopersulfate (a very strong chemical oxidizer about the same strength as chlorine).

## Reaction of Chlorine with Potassium Bromide
Chlorine is bubbled through the potassium bromide layer. The chlorine reacts with the bromide to form bromine. The aqueous layer contains a mixture of bromine bromide ion and tribromide ion. Bromine is also dissolved in the carbon tetrachloride layer to form a reddish solution.

 · Although bromine and chlorine are the usual suspects they are not alone; most transition metals have copious isotopes and sulphur as a significant 4% +2 peak. Secondly it's not generally a good idea just to add one to what you think is the molecular weight and hope that this is the correct value for your parent ion.
