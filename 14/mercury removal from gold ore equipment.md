## Mercury
Mercury a dangerous pollutant is the preferred method employed by small-scale miners for gold recovery. Gold extraction using mercury is comprised of the following four stages: 1) amalgamation 2) separation of amalgamation 3) removal of excess mercury and 4) burning of the remaining amalgam to produce a gold sponge. Mercury can be released

The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.

Concentration means increasing the amount of gold in ore or sediment by selectively removing lighter particles. If employed effectively concentration methods can eliminate or greatly reduce the need for mercury. Before concentration can begin ore must be crushed or milled to liberate gold particles from rock and to decrease grain size.
