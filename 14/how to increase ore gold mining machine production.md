Although production operations tend to be separate and cyclic in nature the trend in modern mining and tunneling is to eliminate or combine functions and to increase continuity of extraction. For example in coal and other soft rock mines continuous miners break and load the mineral to eliminate drilling and blasting; boring machines perform the same tasks in medium-hard rock.
