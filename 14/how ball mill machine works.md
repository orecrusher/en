## Milling Machine: Methods of Milling. Milling Processes 
 · Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed the overall removal is quite brisk.

## Ball mill 
 · The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force. At a certain height it will automatically fall and impact and grind the material in the cylinder to grind the material.

## Principle and Working of MILLING MACHINE 
 · Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating cutter having single or multiple cutting edges. Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy. A milling machine may also be used for drilling slotting making a circular profile and gear cutting by having suitable attachments.
