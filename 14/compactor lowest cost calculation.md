 · The geochemical consequences of compaction and compositional convection can be observed in the zoning patterns of minerals with low diffusivity rates such as plagioclase. While the constant core composition is well known to result from near isothermal crystallization in the magma body in slow cooling conditions rim compositions will be highly dependent on postcumulus processes.
