Some metals like gold silver platinum etc are found in the free state in the earth's crust because they are least reactive. Most metals are found as oxides carbonates sulphides halides etc. Minerals:-are elements or compounds which occur naturally insidethe earth's crust. Ore:-is a mineral from which metals can be extracted profitably.

2. What do you mean by reactivity series of metals? Ans: The reaction of metals with oxygen water and acids shows that metals have different reactivates. Potassium and sodium are the most reactive whereas silver and gold are the least reactive. An arrangement of metals in decreasing order of reactivity is called the reactivity series of metals. 3.

 · Fire assaying has been practiced since ancient times and has proven to be very reliable in the determination of precious metals. References to fire assaying are found in the old testament of the Bible and artifacts in past civilizations' ruins. Assaying began to appear in French and English literature in the 12th century and from there spread to the rest of Europe shortly after.

 · Silver gold and platinum are metals with the least reactivity. They are found in nature. The metals with high reactive series in the above table also indies that reverse reaction is a bit tough process. Reactions are mostly Exothermic in case of highly reactive metals. The reaction takes place fast in highly reactive metals.

Native metal. Native gold partially embedded in quartz gangue. Only gold silver copper and the platinum metals occur in nature in larger amounts. Over geological time scales very few metals can resist natural weathering processes like oxidation. This is why only the less reactive metals such as gold and platinum are found as native metals.

Precious metals gold silver platinum palladium and. Platinum (PT) Platinum is more precious than gold it is a very strong dense metal that never corrodes.In its pure form it is harder than gold and silver so for jewellery it is alloyed with 5% of other metals usually Iridium (another even rarer metal in the platinum family) to make it more workable.

extraction of metals of low reactivity silver. Extraction of Low Reactivity Metals Metals like copper mercury silver and gold are less reactive. Metals at the bottom of the reactivity series can be obtained by heating their compounds. For example when cinnabar (HgS) is heated in a furnace it is reduced to metallic mercury.

## Occurrence and Properties of Metals 
Only gold silver copper and the platinum metals occur in nature in larger amounts. Over geological time scales very few metals can resist natural weathering processes like oxidation. This is why only the less reactive metals such as gold and platinum are found as native metals.
