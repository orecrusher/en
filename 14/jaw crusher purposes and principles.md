## Jaw Crusher 
Rose and English [9] determined the capacity of a jaw crusher by considering the time taken and the distance travelled by the particles between the two plates after being subjected to repeat crushing forces between the jaws. Therefore dry particles wedged between level A and level B (Figure 4.4) would leave the crusher at the next reverse movement of the jaw.
