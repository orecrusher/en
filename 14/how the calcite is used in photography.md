## The Learning Zone: How We Use Minerals
Photographic films are coated with different mineral salts. Silver argentite and other silver-bearing minerals are often used in photography. Think about the properties of silver: Silver sallts react with light ; You can see why we use silver in photography. Cameras also need batteries to work. Nickel is used in rechargeable batteries.

## Surprising Uses for Minerals Found at the Crater of 
Most calcite—in the form of limestone—is crushed heated and mixed with water and other materials as a hardening agent in cement. Because calcite dissolves easily in acid it is also used to neutralize the acidity of water and soil. On a more personal level many of us have ingested calcium carbonate as a calcium supplement or an antacid.

Quartz will scratch minerals such as fluorite that have a lower number on the scale. Suppose you tested a piece of pure gold for hardness. Calcite would scratch the gold but gypsum would not because gypsum is a 2 and calcite is a 3. That would mean gold is between the hardness of gypsum and calcite or 2.5 on the scale.

Calcite the most common form of natural calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) a widely distributed mineral known for the beautiful development and great variety of its crystals. It is polymorphous (same chemical formula but different crystal structure) with the minerals aragonite and vaterite and with several forms that apparently exist only under rather extreme experimental conditions.
