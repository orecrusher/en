## Gold extraction 
Among free-milling gold ores placer gold is a special case as there is no pre-treatment required for gold extraction. Gold can be extracted from placer ores using physical separation techniques particularly through gravity treatment. In modern practice concentrators use centrifugal force in order to liberate finer gold particles.

 · By contrast many metallic ores occur naturally mixed with large quantities of unwanted material – gangue – from which they have to be separated: the mineral dressing process. The proportion of waste tends to increase the more valuable the product metal because high value products (such as gold or platinum) can justify the cost of extracting and processing low-grade ores.

Opening-circuit grinding is that in the grinding operation the material is fed into the mill and discharged after a grinding directly into the next mill or the next process.. The advantages of opening-circuit grinding are simple processing flow and lower investment cost. While the disadvantages are lower production rate and large energy consumption.

## Topic 3: Ore processing and metal recovery
 · Grinding (milling):Grinding is done in grinding machinery in the presence of water and therefore generates tailings.The final particle size that emerges from grinding will depend on the requirements of the subsequent mineral separation stage (1 cm – 0.001 mm) Ball mill for grinding rock materials into fine powder.

 · The ball mill is not suitable for the gravity separation process in metal ore beneficiation due to its fine grinding materials and prone to over-crushing but it is widely used in other beneficiation processes. The grinding mill continues to be one of the most important pieces of equipment in mineral processing plants.
