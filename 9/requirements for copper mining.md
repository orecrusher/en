Once all the necessary requirements have been met or taken into consideration new mines can be established. Opening New REE Mines. The technology to mine and refine REEs from bedrock deposits only became available in the 1960s. Before then only placer deposits which are created from density sorting by water currents were used for mining REEs.

## Copper extraction 
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source local environmental regulations and other factors.. As in all mining operations the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## Current Energy Requirements in the Copper Producing 
 · The mining and mineral concentrating energies are directly proportional to the "recovery efficiency" with a typical mining operation requiring about 20 million Btu/ton of hode copper produced. Mineral concentrating was also found to be a large energy consumer requiring about 43 million Btu/ton of hode copper.
