High-energy ball milling is a ball milling process in which a powder mixture placed in a ball mill is subjected to high-energy collisions from the balls. High-energy ball milling also called mechanical alloying can successfully produce fine uniform dispersions of oxide particles in nickel-base super alloys that cannot be made by conventional powder metallurgy methods.

 · Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed the overall removal is quite brisk.
