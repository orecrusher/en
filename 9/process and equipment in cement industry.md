process and equipment in cement industry. Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay to a fine powder called raw meal which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 °C in a cement kiln In this process the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then they are recombined into

 · Clinkering is the primary step in the cement manufacturing process. The function of the kiln in the cement industry is to first convert limestone into lime then react it with silica aluminum oxide and ferric oxide to form clinker compounds: C 3 S C 2 S C 3 A and C 4 AF. The kiln is the heart of this production process.

In this process the hydrated cement reacts with CO 2 in the air slowly reversing some of the processes that took place in the kiln when the cement was made (this is the carbonation process; it also causes reinforcement corrosion see Section 25.3.2). It is estimated that this may reduce the carbon footprint of the cement industry by 3–5%.
