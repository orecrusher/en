 · Production of spherical graphite is an attractive goal for mine developers since the added value downstream product can achieve much higher returns than basic concentrate. The average value of spherical graphite exported from China is typically 3-4 times higher than small- to medium-sized flake concentrate (the preferred flake size for this industry) at around US$3000/t in early 2019.
