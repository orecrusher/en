## New water spray system reduces dust in coal mines
 · The large continuous mining machines use a rotating cutting drum studded with tooth-like bits to rip coal loose from the coal seams before scooping it into a conveyer system. The cutting process and the falling tumbling coal create continuous clouds of dust that obscure the machine operator's sight and cause health and safety risks.

## Simulation of the Working Performance of a Shearer Cutting 
 · In this paper the time step was 20%. Rayleigh time step was calculated as 3.42 e − 06 s. The simulation time was 6 s the target storage time interval was 0.01 s and the grid size was 5 times that of the minimum particle radius and the coal mining machine cutting coal rock process is shown in Figure 3. <- Prev.

## Structure Improvement Design and Stress Analysis of Coal 
Cutting tooth is an important cutting part in coal winning machine work mechanism. In order to study the cutting tooth structure influence on its stress and strength two different structure simulation model of embedded cutting tooth and outsourcing cutting tooth were established on the basis of the existing design of cutter tooth structure. We had carried on the finite element analysis and
