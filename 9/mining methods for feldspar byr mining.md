Most sheet mica is mined in India where labor costs are comparatively low. Flake Mica Mining: The flake mica produced in the U.S. comes from several sources: the metamorphic rock called schist as a by-product of processing feldspar and kaolin resources from placer deposits and from pegmatites. It is mined by conventional open-pit methods.
