## The operating principle of the ball mill 
 · The operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps. In a continuously operating ball mill feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong being exposed by grinding media. The material grinding occurs during impact falling grinding balls and abrasion the particles between the balls. Then discharge of ground material performed

## Optimizing your SAG mill operation 
 · The mill discharge from these mills consists of slurry which goes to the ball mills for further grinding and coarse pebbles/rocks which are crushed and sent back to the mill. To maximize the capacity of these circuits the general practice is to use grates with pebble ports (reaching 100 mm) instead of normal grate openings to increase the pebble removal.

Based on experience acquired over the years and the investigative work conducted by F.C. Bond it was established that the optimum circulating load for a closed ball mill – cyclone circuit is around 250%. This value is used as guideline for the design of new circuits as well as to assess the performance of existing circuits.
