## How do heat recovery systems work 
Heat recovery systems work by drawing on that potentially valuable warm air or water in a property and getting it to work just a little bit harder for us. In a world without a green technology like heat recovery air circulates around an office becomes stale and is replaced by colder air that it is warmed up by the ventilation system.

## Thermal Oxidizers 
Convection recuperators are used for heat recovery downstream of industrial furnaces incinerators and in-process engineering processes where high-temperature exhaust gasses are produced. Radiation recuperators are best suited for the highest waste gas temperatures in systems where exhaust gasses have high dust concentrations such as forging furnaces melting furnaces glass melters and kilns.

## Waste heat recovery 
Waste heat as low as 45°C can easily be recovered by special heat pumps to produce output temperatures in excess of 100°C suitable for commercial and industrial appliions traditionally dependent on gas for heating. Use of heat pumps may even prove a stepping stone towards complete replacement of boilers and steam systems in the long term.

## Heat exchangers 
The heat of the pasteurized milk is utilized to warm the cold milk. The incoming cold milk is pre-heated by the outgoing hot milk which is simultaneously pre-cooled. This saves heating and refrigeration energy. The process takes place in a heat exchanger and is called regenerative heat exchange or more commonly heat recovery.
