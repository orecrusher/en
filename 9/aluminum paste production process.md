## Aluminium 
Global aluminium production is expected to continue expanding driven by population and GDP growth. Clean energy transitions will also impact aluminium demand with potential for upward pressure from technology shifts that require greater use of aluminium e.g. for lightweight vehicles and solar energy (which uses aluminium for various components).

## Industrial Production Technology for Aluminium Paste 
Unique properties of aluminium mean that it is widely used in various industries. The construction industry is no exception – here aluminium is actively used as a gassing agent for production of steam-cured aerated concrete which is produced by mixing Portland cement sand water and aluminium fine powder or aluminium paste.

## Aluminum Casting Processes :: Total Materia Article
Alloys of aluminum are used in die casting more extensively than alloys of any other base metal. In the United States alone about 2.5 billion dollars worth of aluminum alloy die castings is produced each year. The die casting process consumes almost twice as much tonnage of aluminum alloys as all other casting processes combined.

## How aluminum beverage can is made 
Some aluminum is lost at several points in the manufacturing process—when the blanks are cut and the ears are trimmed—but this scrap can be reused. Cans which have been used and discarded by consumers can also be reused and as mentioned above recycled material makes up a significant percentage of the aluminum used for beverage cans.

## Advantages Disadvantages of Aluminium Fabriion
 · Aluminium is not a good conductor of heat so when welding a break could occur if precision and care are not taking throughout the entire process. A welding breakthrough often happens if when applying the voltage it is not applied to the right spot; however it can be overcome by following best practice procedures and using careful planning techniques.

## Alternative Aluminum Production Processes
 · Due to the relatively high energy consumption and furthermore the carbon footprint of carbon anode consumption other methods of aluminum fabriion have been continually considered. The Hall-Héroult process is also approaching the theoretical minimum in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The Chloride process is one of those alternative processes.

## All About Aluminum Fabriion 
 · Aluminum's mass production can be attributed to the Hall-Héroult process for extracting aluminum patented in 1886 which is still used today. The aluminum manufacturing process starts with the mining of bauxite with every four pounds of bauxite being refined into two pounds of alumina.
