## Iron Ore Smelting Process 
 · Iron ore is obtained in the conventional method of open cast or underground mining and conveying the ore to the surface preparation are where it is crushed washed and transported to the smelter. Here the ore is put into a blast furnace along with limestone and coke and subjected to hot air blasting and heat which converts the ore to molten iron.

Most iron ore is extracted through opencast mines.

Iron ore | BHP. Iron ore is mixed with coke (from super-heated metallurgical coal) in a blast furnace. Air that has been heated to around 1200 degrees Celsius is injected into the furnace creating a flame temperature of 2000 degrees. This converts the iron ore to molten pig iron and slag. Then impurities are removed and alloying elements

 · The process of ironmaking takes place in the blast furnace a highly productive unit capable of turning out several thousand tons daily of molten iron known as "hot metal" or "pig iron" (if cast). Inside the blast furnace a high-temperature reducing atmosphere is maintained while fuel and ore are fed into the furnace more or less continuously through the top.
