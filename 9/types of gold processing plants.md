## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching – An Introduction 
 · Nature of Gold: The surface of a gold particle will typically be dissolved at a rate of around 0.2-0.5 µm of surface depth per hour in a cyanide leach. For large gold particles and nuggets this is too slow to be fully dissolved in a typical processing plant. Much simpler and less expensive gravity methods are available to recover this gold.
