 · India's steel vision of 2030 requires a huge amount of quality iron ore. The utilization of low-grade iron ores such as banded iron ores will play an important role to achieve the same production. The absence of alumina impurities in the banded hematite jasper (BHJ) ore provides it an edge over other low-grade iron ores. The conventional beneficiation techniques such as magnetic separation

This study is to investigate the beneficiating possibility of a low grade lead ore in Yunnan by current mineral processing technology. A low grade lead ore sample assaying 1.14%Pb and 5.72g/t Ag was used in tests. In the experiment gravity pre-concentration to discard the tailings and the effects of grinding fineness types and dosages of reagents in roughing were investigated.

 · Abstract. Bauxite is the major alumina (Al 2 O 3) bearing ore used in the aluminum manufacturing industries.The bauxite containing less than 50% Al 2 O 3 is called low-grade bauxite ore which is commonly used for the alumina-based abrasives and refractories productions. The alumina-silica and alumina-ferrite complexes are the foremost impurities present in the low-grade bauxite.

In recent years extraction of zinc from low-grade mining tailings of oxidized zinc has been a matter of discussion. This is a material which can be processed by flotation and acid-leaching methods. Owing to the similarities in the physicochemical and surface chemistry of the constituent minerals separation of zinc oxide minerals from their gangues by flotation is an extremely complex process.

Low-grade iron ore includes all mixtures below 62% iron concentration which are not considered to be viable types of ore for use in metallurgy. Several different types of natural iron ore exist but the two most common types used for metal refining are hematite Fe 2 O 3 which is usually 70% iron and magnetite Fe 3 O 4 which is 72% iron.

The economic mineral reserves for PGMs are found in the Busheveld Complex geological formation of South Africa particularly in the narrow strata of Merensky Reef (Platreef) and the UG2 chromitite layer.
