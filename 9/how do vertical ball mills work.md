Work on a milling machine is most often held in a vise clamped onto the bed. To make features aligned with the edges of the stock it's neccessary to align the vise with the feed axes of the mill. To do this mount the vise on the bed and secure it with T-bolts but only lightly so as to permit adjustment of the orientation of the vise.
