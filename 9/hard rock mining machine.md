## Mining Technology in the Nineteenth Century 
Miners used mechanical crushing and grinding machines to break up ores for further processing. Early miners used Mexican arrastras or stamp mills which reached their peak in the late nineteenth century to crush ores into sand-size particles. Before going to stamp mills ores often went through rock crushers which were like nutcrackers.

## Environmental Risks of Mining
Hardrock mining exposes rock that has lain unexposed for geological eras. When crushed these rocks expose radioactive elements asbestos-like minerals and metallic dust. During separation residual rock slurries which are mixtures of pulverized rock and liquid are produced as tailings toxic and radioactive elements from these liquids can leak into bedrock if not properly contained.

Each blow shatters the rock in front of the bit - the steel and bit then rotates slightly and it shatters new rock while air is blown down the center of the drill steel clearing the bit face and blowing the chips up and out of the hole.
