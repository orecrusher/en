## Selective elution of gold silver and mercury cyanide from 
 · A high-pressure laboratory elution rig was commissioned to simulate industrial Zadra and AARL elution conditions for the stripping of gold silver and mercury from loaded activated carbon. It was found that cyanide was essential for the efficient elution of both mercury and silver while gold was found to elute most effectively in hot low-ionic strength solutions. Therefore the standard AARL

The classic method of recovery of gold and silver from cyanide solution was Merrill Crowe until the introduction of Carbon In Pulp (CIP) in the 1970's. The CIP process indied savings in CAPEX. This meant that lower grade ores could be economically treated than otherwise would have been the case. Soluble losses from CIP plants are lower than Merrill Crowe and the process is less vulnerable

## Carbon in pulp 
 · The carbon-in-pulp process is used to treat low grade gold and/or silver ores. The ore is first ground in a ball mill which operates in closed circuit with a cyclone or similar sizing device. This is done to produce a feed suitably sized so that subsequent leaching is rapid.

## Carbon in pulp 
Leached pulp and carbon are transferred in a counter current flow arrangement between a series of tanks usually numbering 4 to 6. In the final tank fresh or barren carbon is put in contact with low grade or tailings solution. At this tank the fresh carbon has a high activity and can remove trace amounts of gold (to levels below 0.01 mg/L Au in solution).
