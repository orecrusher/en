"Iron in the blood gets diffused in the heart tissue. The way you diagnose excessive iron accumulation in the heart is by using cardiac MRI test results. In those 3D images the heart looks black." To mirror iron-overload disease in the lab the researchers exposed the balls of heart cells to increasing concentrations of iron.

Iron is mentioned numerous times in the Old Testament of the Bible. A remarkable iron pillar dating to about A.D. 400 remains standing today in Delhi India. This solid shaft of wrought iron is about 7 1/4 m high by 40 cm in diameter. Corrosion to the pillar has been minimal although it has been exposed to the weather since its creation.
