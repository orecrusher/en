## Cement Kilns: Planetary Coolers 
The coolers in practice were almost useless. Masons using them up to the 1960s recorded clinker outlet temperature around 1000°C and the "quenching" of the clinker necessary for good quality was delayed until it fell out onto the conveyor.. A modest improvement in performance could be obtained by fitting a "van der Werp" cooler. This involved perforating the shell of the kiln

## Conversion to High
The grate cooler is integral to heat recovery from the clinker so grate coolers that operate with higher efficiencies will lead to less wasted heat and reduce fuel usage elsewhere in the process. The grate coolers offer two main advantages. First they can have a large capacity allowing large kiln capacities. Second they offer efficient heat recovery by lowering the emperature of the clinker

 · Clinker Grate Cooler for Cement Plant. The Grate cooler is a quench cooler. After the clinker enters the cooling machine from the kiln a layer of a certain thickness is laid on the slab and the blasted cold air is quenched in the direction perpendicular to each other through the layer of the moving material on the boring machine to allow the clinker to be quenched.
