## DESIGN OF STABLE SLOPE FOR OPENCAST MINES
In India the number of operating opencast mines is steadily increasing as compared to underground mines. It is due to low gestation period higher productivity and quick rate of investment. On the contrary opencast mining attracts environmental concerns such as solid-waste management land degradation and socio-economical problems.
