The gold in the crushed ore was rather large and chunky and there was virtually no black sand in it. I had expected the sluice to do well with the ore. A more real-world test would be to see how it handles fine gold mixed with black sand like what it would be seeing if I fed it gold-bearing stream gravel.

The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.
