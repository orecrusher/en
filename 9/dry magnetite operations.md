## Dry macular degeneration 
 · Dry macular degeneration is a common eye disorder among people over 50. It causes blurred or reduced central vision due to thinning of the macula (MAK-u-luh). The macula is the part of the retina responsible for clear vision in your direct line of sight. Dry macular degeneration may first develop in one or both eyes and then affect both eyes.

A process for upgrading low-grade magnetite-containing iron ore with minimum fine grinding. The dry ore is first comminuted to between about three-fourths inch and 10 mesh particle size and magnetically separated. The dry tailing is discarded and the concentrate is ground to between about 20 and 100 mesh and again subjected to dry magnetic separation.
