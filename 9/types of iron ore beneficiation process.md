## Summary of Iron Ore Beneficiation Process and Technology 
There are many mineral processing methods and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.
