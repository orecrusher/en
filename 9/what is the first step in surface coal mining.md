## How is coal mined and extracted? 
First of all the layer of earth – overburden – above the first coal seam has to be removed. (The seam can be up to 200 meters below the surface.) All the earth around the base of the seam is removed before extraction begins. When the hole is large enough the miners dig down to the next layer of coal. Each layer is called a bench.

Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed. It is the other way of underground mining in which the overlying rock is left behind and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.. Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface

This step in the mining process is critical to ensuring the sustainability of the land for future use. First waste dumps are contoured to flatten them out and stabilize them. If the ore contains sulfides it is covered with a layer of clay to prevent rain and oxygen from oxidizing the sulfides into sulfuric acid which is also known as acid mine drainage.

 · The mine was first founded in 1914 by the Cyprus Mines Corporation and has since been almost continuously operational. However the history of mining in Cyprus has recorded a few disruptions over the years. Production stopped temporarily during World War II and during the 1974 Cypriot coup d'état.

First of all the layer of earth – overburden – above the first coal seam has to be removed. (The seam can be up to 200 meters below the surface.) All the earth around the base of the seam is removed before extraction begins. When the hole is large enough the miners dig down to the next layer of coal

 · Woodhouse Colliery is set to be the UK's first new deep coal mine in 30 years — but the decision to approve it has been contentious for many. Based on a coastal site near Whitehaven West Cumbria the £165m ($216m) mine will produce about 2.5 million tonnes of coking coal annually when it begins operations.

## The Actual Difference Between Surface and Underground Mining
In all methods of surface mining first the overburden is stripped off using earthmovers.Then bucket-wheel excavators remove the ore which is loaded into haul trucks with shovel loaders. When the deposit is exhausted the overburden is refilled in the crater and the land is restored with the local vegetation.

## The Coal Mining Industry Is Collapsing and Communities 
 · Congress passed the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) in 1977 to end the practice of mine operators abandoning mines once all of the profitable coal had been removed. Congress built safeguards into the new law to discourage operators from abandoning mines and to require they set aside money to guarantee that no costs fell on taxpayers if mines were abandoned.
