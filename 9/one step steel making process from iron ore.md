These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.

Molten iron is an alloy of 96% iron with carbon phosphorus silicon and sulfur impurities; It is too brittle for most uses so most of it is converted into steel by removing some of the impurities; Not all of the carbon is removed as steel contains some carbon the percentage of which depends on the use of the steel

## Infographic: the Iron and Steel Manufacturing Process
 · Steel is made primarily in a two-step process. In the primary steelmaking step liquid iron is converted into steel by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) process or by melting scrap steel or direct reduced iron (DRI) in an electric arc furnace. Secondary steelmaking is a refining process in which alloying metals are added and impurities are removed.

## Creating Steel 
The open-hearth furnace is one way to create steel from pig iron. The pig iron limestone and iron ore go into an open-hearth furnace. It is heated to about 1600 degrees F (871 degrees C). The limestone and ore form a slag that floats on the surface. Impurities including carbon are oxidized and float out of the iron into the slag.

Iron and steel making by-products. As with all large-scale manufacturing processes the production or iron and steel generates by-products. On average the production of 1 tonne of steel results in 200 kg (EAF) to 400 kg (BF/BOF) of by-products. The main by-products produced during iron and crude steel production are slags (90%) dusts and sludges.

## Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap – Analysis 
While iron ore is the source of around 70% of the metallic raw material inputs to steelmaking globally the rest is supplied in the form of recycled steel scrap. Steel production from scrap requires around one-eighth of the energy of that produced from iron ore – mainly in the form of electricity rather than coal for production from iron ore.

## How is Wrought Iron Made? 
The process of making the various kinds of iron and steel is described below. The difference between iron and steel is based on the amount of carbon contained in the metal. If less than 0.1% carbon is present in the metal it is termed wrought iron and it remains a ductile metal that can be heated and welded but not hardened; it can be softened but not made fluid by an ordinary furnace even

The important feature of the EAF steelmaking process is that the raw materials are recycled steel scrap and fluxes without the step of iron ore extraction. This results in overall cost of per tonne of annual installed capacity in the range of $127–182/t ($140–200/ton) for an EAF-based operation compared to approximately $1110/t ($1000/ton) for a BF-BOF-based operation ( Jones 1988 ).

## How steel is made 
To make steel iron ore is first mined from the ground. It is then smelted in blast furnaces where the impurities are removed and carbon is added. In fact a very simple definition of steel is "iron alloyed with carbon usually less than 1%." Blast furnaces require many auxiliary facilities to support their operations.

## Iron 
Some steels need a very low concentration of sulfur which can make it brittle and can lead to structural failure. Unlike other impurities which are removed from the hot metal by oxidation in the oxygen converter the most economic method of removing sulfur from the hot iron is prior to the steel-making process.
