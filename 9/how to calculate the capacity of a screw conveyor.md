 · Lay the screw next to a ruler or measuring tape and hold it steady. Count the number of threads in the space of an inch to get the thread spacing for screws in the imperial system. Thread counts in the imperial system generally range from 35-40 threads per inch. The thread spacing is also called the thread pitch.
