## Foundation Engineering Problems and Hazards in Karst Terranes
The most common type of bedrock in karst terranes is carbonate rock which includes limestone (calcium carbonate) dolostone (calcium-magnesium carbonate) and marble (calcium carbonate). There are a few other kinds of rock (e.g. gypsum which is composed of calcium sulfate) that can be involved in karst but in Maryland karst terranes are limited to areas underlain by carbonate rocks.
