A new method of effecting flotation of mineral grains on a laboratory scale is provided wherein a mineral sample of uniform grain size and uniform mineral composition is conditioned to produce a definite degree of adsorption and then subjected to flotation. The floating mineral grains are separated at time intervals to let the flotation rate coefficient to be determined.

A new method of effecting flotation of mineral grains on a laboratory scale is provided wherein a mineral sample of uniform grain size and uniform mineral composition is conditioned to produce a definite degree of adsorption and then subjected to flotation. The floating mineral grains are separated at time intervals to let the flotation rate coefficient to be determined.

## Lime in Flotation and Recovery Processes 
Lime is used extensively in the recovery of gold and silver. Ores either run-of-mine milled autoclaved or roasted are combined with lime and a cyanide solution. The cyanide dissolves the gold and silver. Lime maintains proper pH in the cyanide solution keeping it in the liquid phase and preventing the formation of hydrogen cyanide gas and its loss into the atmosphere.
