Natural stone used as a building or landscaping material can decrease the urban heat island effect if the solar reflectance index of the surface is sufficient. Roofing tiles large decorative pieces and other stone on a building's envelope may inhibit energy absorption. Paving or landscaping with stone may also result in similar advantages.
