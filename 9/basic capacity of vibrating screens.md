## the size screen of vibrating screen
Basic concepts of vibrating screens: What they are what The screens serve to classify the different particles by size starting from a bulk product in a continuous process. The inlet material (the raw product) advances from the part where the screen is fed to the opposite end in which the particles come out separately according to their size shape or density.
