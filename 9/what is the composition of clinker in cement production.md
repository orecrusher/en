## CLINKER GRINDING IN CEMENT PRODUCTION
 · Clinker (in cement industry) is transitional product in cement production. Upon heating mixture obtained from limestone (about 75%) and clay (about 25%) partial melting occurs and clinker granules are formed. Clinker and gypsum (about 5 %) are mixed and finely milled to obtain cement. Gypsum control the setting properties of the cement.

Clinker: combinability of mixes. The ease of combination ("combinability" or "burnability") is about how easily the raw materials react with each other in the kiln to produce the clinker minerals. Clinker composition is evidently one of the key factors which determine cement quality. Composition is controlled mainly by suitable blending of raw

## Cement Clinker Quality Control During Clinker Production 
During normal production process the clinker is always calcined in a fixed temperature range. According to the fluctuation of raw meal composition the calcination temperature of clinker is generally between 1350℃ and 1450℃. If the temperature in the kiln is too low it is easy to produce underfired clinker.

## What is Cement Clinker? 
 · Clinker is a nodular material produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement and is used as the binder in many cement products. The lumps or nodules of clinker are usually of diameter 3-25 mm and dark grey in color. It is produced by heating limestone and clay to the point of liquefaction at about 1400°C-1500°C in the rotary kiln.

## Effects and Control of Chemical Composition of Clinker for 
 · This research focused the role to study the effects and ways to control the chemical composition of clinker for better cement production. Cement is a substance produced by grinding a mixture of a clay and limestone and heating to a temperature of 1450°C in which the chemical transformation occurs inside the kiln to form new compound called clinker.

 · The resulting clinker (rounded nodules between 1mm and 25mm across) is ground to a fine powder in a cement mill and mixed with gypsum to create cement. The powdered cement is then mixed with water and aggregates to form concrete that is used in construction. Clinker quality depends on raw material composition.

2. Clinker production Clinker production is the most energy-intensive step in the cement production. Temperatures over 900°C transform the limestone (CaCO 3) into lime (CaO) thus releasing CO 2. This is called the calcination process. The calcinated raw meal reaches temperatures of up to 1450°C which allow its sintering to form clinker.

## What is Cement Clinker? Composition Types Uses 
Clinker is a nodular material produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement and is used as the binder in many cement products. The lumps or nodules of clinker are usually of diameter 3-25 mm and dark grey in color. It is produced by heating limestone and clay to the point of liquefaction at about 1400°C-1500°C in the rotary kiln.

## Emissions from the Cement Industry 
 · Though "cement" and "concrete" are often used interchangeably concrete is actually the final product made from cement. The primary component of cement is limestone. To produce cement limestone and other clay-like materials are heated in a kiln at 1400°C and then ground to form a lumpy solid substance called clinker; clinker is then combined with gypsum to form cement.

## Tyres as an alternative fuel 
 · The use of tyres as a fuel in cement production influences kiln operation and clinker composition. Sulphur - Due to the high sulphur content the circulation of volatile salts increases - depending on the sulphur content of the substituted coal - and therefore the coating tendencies in the area of the kiln inlet riser and lower cyclones also increase.

Alite is the main mineral (>50%) in most modern clinker and is the characteristic mineral of Portland cement. Alite only becomes stable above 1250°C and can't form unless the burning temperature gets above that at some stage. Thus in early cements that were burned at a lower temperature alite was not formed (except accidentally) and it was William Aspdin who first produced it when he invented
