the pyrometallurgical process ore concentrate containing lead zinc or both is fed in some cases after sintering into a primary smelter. Lead concentrations can be 50-70% and the sulfur content of sulfidic ores is in the range of 15-20%. Zinc concentration is in the range of 40-60% with sulfur content in sulfidic ores in the range of 26-34%.

## :: WorstPolluted : Projects Reports
Primary lead is mined separated from ore and refined into various products whereas secondary lead is recovered from used objects – such as used lead-acid batteries – for reuse in other products. Smelting is a key process in lead product production and involves heating lead ore or recovered lead with chemical reducing agents.

Ore is processed using conventional techniques and differential flotation. Ore is passed to the primary crusher and crushed to 150mm. This is passed to the secondary and tertiary crushers and ground to 16mm. After milling the ore is fed into the flotation circuit. Following differential flotation zinc lead and copper concentrates are produced.

In 1977 ore reserves were 2.40 million tonnes.4 About 25 minerals were extracted by underground mining; ores contained principally large amounts of lead and zinc and lesser quantities of silver and cadmium.4 All mining activities officially ceased in 1994.

Galena is the main ore of lead used since ancient times since lead can be smelted from galena in an ordinary wood fire. Galena typically is found in hydrothermal veins in association with sphalerite marcasite chalcopyrite cerussite anglesite dolomite calcite quartz barite and fluorite.It is also found in association with sphalerite in low-temperature lead-zinc deposits within

## Lead
The established lead-zinc ore flotation processing scheme is to add zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) to the grind to control metal ion activation (sphalerite depression). Often metabisulphide or other sulphidation chemicals are added with the zinc sulphate for iron sulphide mineral depression.

The process is carried out in a series of tanks. As the lead and zinc minerals are less readily wetted than the gangue they adhere to the air bubbles which are carried to the surface. The rock particles sink and the lead and zinc ores are skimmed off. Then the lead ore is separated from the zinc ore.
