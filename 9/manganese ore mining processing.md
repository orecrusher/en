## A Case Study ofthe Production ofHigh
ficiating manganese ores by means of an agglomeration process were started in the 1970's. These investigations resulted in Ihe erection of a 500 ktla sinter plant at Samancor's Mamatwan manganese mjne in 1987. This plant initially produced a 44 per cent manganese sinter from a feed of 38 per cent carbonaceous manganese are.
