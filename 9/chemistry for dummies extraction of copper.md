## Microscale extraction of copper 
In this experiment students heat copper(II) oxide in the presence of hydrogen gas to extract copper. The copper(II) oxide reacts with hydrogen and is reduced producing copper and water. This can be used to show the relative positions of copper and hydrogen in the reactivity series and can also be used for percentage yield-type calculations.

## What is the role of silica in the extraction of copper 
Ores of copper contain iron oxide as an impurity. Silica reacts with iron oxide and forms iron silie which is removed as slag. In the smelting process such chemical reactions are taking place: 1) Oxidizing of the copper pyrite: 2 CuFeS2 (s) + 3 O2 (g) → 2 FeO (s) + 2 CuS (l) + 2 SO2 (g) 2) Conversion of iron oxides and sulfides into molten slag: FeO (s) + SiO2 (s) → FeSiO3 (l) 2 FeS (s
