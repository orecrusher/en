## History of Salt 
Solution mining of rock salt deposits spread rapidly throughout the salt producing states. When rock salt deposits were reached by drilling conventional underground mining soon followed. Salt mining continues today throughout North America in Kansas Louisiana Ohio New York Texas Ontario New Brunswick (potash and salt) Quebec and Nova Scotia.

## Extracting salt from mines 
Most salt mines operate underground but in salt deserts the rock salt is also mined at the surface. Two main methods of extracting rock salt are used in underground mining: Cut and blast mining consists in cutting slots at the base of the rock face. A series of carefully sited holes are drilled and then charged with explosives to blast the rock.
