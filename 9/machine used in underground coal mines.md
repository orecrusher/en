## Safety of roof
 · Roof bolting was introduced in U.S. Coal mines in 1948. As a result there has been a significant reduction of the number of accidents due to roof falls. It may seem ironic that operators of roof-bolting machines now incur the largest number of accidents in underground coal mining. Clearly something must be done to reduce the hazards.
