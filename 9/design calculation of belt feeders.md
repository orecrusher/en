 · Most of the previous researches on belt weigh feeders [1–4] have not performed detailed modelling of belt weigh feeder system and the focus was only on controller design. In the present research mathematical modelling has been attempted as it provides good insights into the variables affecting the dynamics of the system although complete non-linearity can't be exactly modelled.

Calculation of the nominal flow can be done once the screw geometry its rotation speed and the filling coefficient are known. The flow rate of a screw conveyor or feeder depends on a number of interlinked factors: - geometry of the screw - rotation speed - inclination - geometry of the feed hopper and tube - flowability of the material.
