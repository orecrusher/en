## Dust suppression in iron ore processing plants 
 · Handling taconite pellets produces dust. As the pellets are transported they abrade and produce a fine material that represents a concern for airborne dust. Pellet-breakdown studies revealed that as much as 43% (by weight) of the fine particles were 10 μm in diameter and smaller (material regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). This is a significant amount of material that
