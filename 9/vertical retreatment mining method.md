 · Vertical crater retreat is another variation of long-hole stoping and is used for ore bodies that are steeply dipping. Depending on the type of ore body the appropriate variation is selected. Shrinkage Stoping. Shrinkage stoping is an overhand mining method that is used for self-supporting vertical ore bodies.

## A New Fast Vertical Method for Mining Frequent Patterns
Vertical mining methods are very effective for mining frequent patterns and usually outperform horizontal mining methods. However the vertical methods become ineffective since the intersection time starts to be costly when the cardinality of tidset (tid-list or diffset) is very large or there are a very large number of transactions.
