Iron and Manganese. Iron may exist in water as a ferrous or ferric inorganic salt or as a sequestered organic complex. Ferrous iron exchanges in resin but ferric iron is insoluble and does not. Ferric iron coats ion resin preventing exchange. An acid or a strong reducing agent must be used to remove this iron.

To make calcium silie bricks silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand–lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170°C (340°F) for several hours. Some gel similar to the calcium silie hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement is formed and this bonds the sand particles together.
