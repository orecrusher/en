## Crushing Concrete Cube or Cylinder at 28 days
 · The crushing of concrete cubes or cylinder samples is required in a construction especially concrete structures. The reason why this is to verify the strength given in the design mix. Let say for example for a concrete column commonly it has 60 megapascals of specified strength. When you crush it the result should be equal or more than 60 Mpa. The specified strength should be achieved
