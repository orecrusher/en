Core making is the process which forms the interior part of the casting. The mold provides a space for the molten metal to go while the core keeps the metal from filling the entire space. Cores can be used to extend mold projections to create extra mold sections or to block out and create negative drafts.

Mold-Making: Creating a mold is the first step in the sand casting process. Each casting needs a mold. A sand mold is formed by putting the sand into each half of the mold. The sand is stacked around the pattern which is a replica of the shape of the casting. When the pattern is removed the cavity forming the casting remains.
