## Analysis of Structural Strength of Horizontal Screw 
 · In order to guide the determination of the key parameters of the Screw Conveyor of the horizontal screw centrifuge and the optimization of the structure a parametric three-dimensional finite element model of the screw conveyor was established by using the finite element analysis software ANSYS. The structural strength analysis and rotor modal analysis were carried out.
