## Face milling 
Face milling with a very high feed per tooth (up to 4 mm/tooth) is possible when using cutters that have small entering angles or when using round insert cutters due to their chip thinning effect. Although the depth of cut is limited to less than 2.8 mm the extreme feed makes it a highly productive milling method.
