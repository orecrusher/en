Mica is ground dry to yield finely divided mica particles prior to forming a sheet. A single sheet of uniform thickness is formed at one time by pouring a colloid mixture of the ground mica water and a colloid agent onto a mesh screen. Vacuum means and a hydraulic press are used to complete the formation of a sheet. The sheet also includes a resin binder.
