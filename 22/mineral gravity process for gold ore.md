## Gravity Gold 
Employing gravity recovery for coarsely liberated gold and sulfide ores has potential to lead to a signifi cant reduction in the energy required for comminution and ultimately can have a significant impact on gold processing. Most of the recognised metallurgical tools at our disposal currently have been designed around recovery of relatively finely ground minerals.

The gravity concentration separation process gets more complex as the specific gravities between the valuable mineral and the gangue get closer. For example complex gold in a sulphide complex of pyrite must isolate a specific gravity of 19.3 for gold from 5.2 for pyrite. Using gravity to recover minerals in their coarsest fraction minimises

## Gold Ore 
Gold ores are classified "free-milling" and "refractory" based on their response to cyanide dissolution. Bioprocessing can be used to treat refractory gold-bearing sulfide ores as well as carbonaceous gold ores. It is essential to characterize different types of gold ores to understand the extent and nature of gold-entrapment in different associated mineral phases before an appropriate
