## Modelling and optimization of a rotary kiln direct 
The kiln model applied in this work was developed by Hatch over a number of years and has been used for several rotary kiln projects. It has its roots in a FORTRAN program that was developed by Venkateswaran (1978) to study the reduction of iron ore. The original software was used to model the operation of a 35 m pilot kiln at the Stellco company

## Mathematical model for a straight grate iron ore pellet 
 · A mathematical model is developed for induration of the iron-ore pellets in an industrial-scale plant based on the laws of mass heat and momentum transfer. Physicochemical processes occurring during the induration of pellets such as drying of moisture calcination of limestone and coke-magnetite reaction are considered to evaluate the gradient of temperature within the pellets.

## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics
 · HistoryIron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore leaving behind a soft malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.

 · Bituminous coal—generally classified as a metallurgical grade—is harder and blacker. It contains more carbon and less moisture and ash than low-rank coals. The grade of coal and its caking ability is determined by the coal's rank—a measure of volatile matter and degree of metamorphism—as well as mineral impurities and the ability of the coal to melt swell and resolidify when heated.

 · While ore grades vary widely copper ores typically contain only about a half-percent by weight of the element itself: thus roughly 200 tons of ore are dug up moved crushed and processed to get to one ton of copper. For rare earths some 20 to 160 tons of ore are mined per ton of element.

 · Before the iron ore in the form of green pellet is entering the straight grate induration furnace it has been processed in different stages. In the sorting-plant the crude ore that has been extracted from the mine is separated from gangue and crushed down to smaller fractions. Further on the crushed iron ore is entering the concentrating plant.

## A dynamic mathematical model of the complete grate/kiln 
Induration (drying and hardening) of iron ore pellets is an energy-intensive feed preparation step for both the blast furnace and direct reduction routes to iron. It is commonly carried out by a 'grate/kiln' process. A mathematical model of the process is described in which mechanistic models of the grate furnace kiln and cooler are linked to enable simulation of the entire process.
