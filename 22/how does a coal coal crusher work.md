type crushers have choke points but this does not necessarily mean that choking is likely to occur. Choking — Stoppage of the flow of material through the crusher usually the result of wet and sticky material clogging exit points. Circulating Load — The amount of oversize returned to the crusher from a screen in a closed-circuit system.

## Dual roll crushers how they function 
Coal is probably the largest user of roll crushers currently though. Coal plants will use roll crushers either single roll or double roll as primary crushers reducing the ROM coal. Usually these crushers will have teeth or raised forms on the face of the roll. (Roll crushers used for minerals and metal ores have smooth faced rolls.)

## ISO 23499:2013(en) Coal ? Determination of bulk density 
This International Standard provides description of a cone procedure for determining an uncompacted bulk density of crushed coal less than 37 mm in size such as is charged into coke ovens. It focuses on the uncompacted bulk density of coal resulting from flowing the material into a measuring container (box) in the absence of compacting forces.

## How Coal Stoves Work 
Stoker coal stoves actually hook up to a thermostat so you can control the temperature in your house. The stove automatically adds coal when necessary to maintain a constant temperature. The biggest difference between hand fired stoves and stoker stoves is that a stoker stove requires electricity to run whereas a hand fired stove does not.
