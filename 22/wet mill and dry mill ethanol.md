## Ethanol 
If ethanol is the target product then it can be produced at a lower cost and more efficiently in a dry mill plant than in a wet mill plant under current economic conditions. In the wet milling process the corn kernel is steeped in hot water before the germ which is high in protein oil and zines is mechanically separated from the endosperm which is high in starch content.

## What is Ethanol Waste? (with pictures) 
Ethanol. Two primary production processes are used in the manufacture of ethanol from corn: dry mill and wet mill. A primary difference between the two processes is the co-products that each generates. Ethanol waste is a co-product of the dry mill production process while gluten feed is a co-product of the wet mill process.

Corn Milling: Wet vs. Dry Milling AMG Engineering These dry fractionation efforts always result in co-products with less purity than those produced by the corn wet milling process. Consequently the ethanol yield from a dry grind / dry fractionation process is negatively impacted as the result of fermentable starch exiting the process with the co-products.

## Ethanol Production 
Traditionally ethanol from corn has primarily been produced through dry- and wet-milling processes. The majority of U.S. ethanol production is from dry-grind technology. The traditional dry-grind process grinds the whole corn kernel and mixes it with water and enzymes. The mash is then cooked to liquefy the starch further.
