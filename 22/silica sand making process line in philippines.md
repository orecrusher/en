Ferrous foundries (those dealing with iron and steel) usually use silica sand sometimes known as quartz sand. Silica sand has long been used in core making so switching to using the same aggregate throughout the casting process has made the process of managing foundry supplies easier. Silica sand is the most commonly used type of foundry sand.

A pH increase from 11.3 to 12.1 reduces the ratio by 50% while a pH increase from 7.8 to 9.0 has no measurable effect. For any boiler pressure and pH the distribution ratio for silica can be determined from Figure 18-3. The amount of silica vaporized with the steam can be determined by measurement of boiler water silica.

Silica is found in sand and sandstone deposits in the form of quartz. After a few crushing and separations steps the starting material is >99% pure SiO 2 and in an appropriate particle size range (see below). In silica sands the impurity with the greatest consequence is iron oxide which causes a brown color in the glass.
