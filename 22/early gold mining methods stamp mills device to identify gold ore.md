The closest practicable definition of these is that in a "free- milling" ore the gold occurs in such a form that it is readily and pretty completely recovered by crushing and amalgama­tion while in refractory ores this is not the case.

Early miners could simply pick nuggets from creeks or with simple panning but as gold became more scarce mining style changed. The mine was abandoned for 75-years until a coal mining family from Kentucky wishing for a change of occupation brought new life to the mine and gave visitors a chance to expereince a turn of the century underground mine.

Dead broke Cruse had to borrow money to work his claim but eventually developed the Drumlummon Mine. Almost immediately he recovered more than $140000 in ore from the mine. Within a short time of Cruse's find word spread of the rich gold vein and miners began to flood the area.

## MINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINE DEVELOPMENT
Ore is the rock from which an element ultimately will be extracted. The weight percent (or grade) of the desired element in the rock varies considerably from one mineral to another at operating mines—much less than 1% by weight for gold more than 60% by weight for some iron-ore mines. Ore usually is transformed into concentrate at the mine site.

About this time a small stamp mill or pounding mill was built near the mine to crush the gold ore; this was probably the first mill of this type to be erected in the United States. The ore was placed on an iron-die plate and crushed by 50-pound wooden stamps with iron shoes. Six stamps were reported in operation at the mine in 1836.

 · By the early 1840s it was becoming difficult for miners to make a living washing the placer deposits and hard-rock gold veins were becoming harder to mine. The heyday of the gold rush was over. In 1849 word of the great California gold strikes reached the miners of Georgia and they began preparing to go west.

The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.

 · Gold is heavier than most other particles so alternative methods typically use motion or water to separate the gold from lighter particles. Panning involves moving sediment that potentially contains gold in a curved pan with water and moving in such a way that any gold will settle at the bottom while the water and other particles will leave the pan.
