With dry grinding these mills often work in a closed cycle. A scheme of the conical ball mill supplied with an air separator is shown in Fig. 2.13. Air is fed to the mill by means of a fan. Carried off by air currents the product arrives at the air separator from which the coarse particles are returned by gravity via a tube into the mill.

Jet mills operate in compressed air gas or high pressure superheated steam. Jet mills have no moving parts thereby eliminating contamination due to contact with external grinding media. It is also an ideal process to grind heat-sensitive and waxy material because no attritional heat is generated. Jet mill works on fluid energy.
