## What is glass on Mohs hardness scale? 
 · Mohs hardness rough measure of the resistance of a smooth surface to scratching or abrasion expressed in terms of a scale devised (1812) by the German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs. The Mohs hardness of a mineral is determined by observing whether its surface is scratched by a substance of known or defined hardness.

however metal hardness becomes less important. Figure 1 shows how abrasion resistance of white irons changes with the ratio of metal to abrasive hardness. At a high ratio abrasion resistance is high but when the ratio drops below 0.6 there is a wide ster and the slope of the curve indies the decreasing influence of metal hardness.

## Hardness Reduction 
Measuring Grains of Hardness Hardness of water is measured in grains per gallon (GPG) or sometimes in parts per million (PPM). One GPG equals 17.1 ppm (Mg/l). Generally water with GPG of 7 or more is considered hard. To determine the hardness of your water it can be tested using simple test strips or a titration drop test.
