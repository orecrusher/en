## Mechanical screening 
Mechanical screening often just called screening is the practice of taking granulated ore material and separating it into multiple grades by particle size.. This practice occurs in a variety of industries such as mining and mineral processing agriculture pharmaceutical food plastics and recycling.. A method of separating solid particles according to size alone is called screening.
