## What is an energy flow diagram? 
Energy Flow Diagrams (aka Energy Flow Charts) are used to visualize energy flows for a country a region or within a company. Energy production or supply is shown in these diagams along with a breakdown of energy consumption by consumer. Visualization of energy flows through Sankey diagrams. Energy management Audits. Increase energy efficiency.

In the interactive chart here we see coal production by country. This has been converted into primary energy equivalents (i.e. terawatt-hours of energy) for comparability across our other data on energy. Note that this measures coal production not consumption. Many countries consume energy from coal in their energy supply.

## Converting a Power Plant from Coal to Natural Gas 
 · Converting a Power Plant from Coal to Natural Gas. Modifying an existing coal-fired boiler to natural gas firing capability either to replace or to supplement coal as the primary fuel source is an extensive – and expensive – project. Although each project is different the scope of the conversion will ultimately determine the installation

The student handout presents a flow chart to show how coal is turned into electricity beginning with a photo of a (clean) miner. The caption explains: "Miners dig for coal in surface or underground mines." The entire flow chart presents a crisp problem-free step-by-step procedure. The smokestacks of coal-burning power plants are invisible.

Note that electrical energy consumption has more than tripled from 5200 to 17400 TWh in 23 years. (17400 TWh = 1496 Mtoe) Over the same period the share of energy generated by nuclear power has shown the greatest growth with other renewables close behind but the majority of the world's electrical power is still generated from coal.

## How is Electricity Generated from Coal? 
 · The electricity generated from coal by a power station is used for different purposes. Thus the electric generator uses the kinetic energy converted from heat to produce power. Step 5Once the turbine starts spinning it rotates the magnets within the copper coil. The spinning of the turbine thus produces electricity.
