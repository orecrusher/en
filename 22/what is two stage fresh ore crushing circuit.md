Ore is treated using a two-stage crushing process followed by a two-stage grinding circuit that consists of a semi-autogenous grinding mill and a ball mill. Most of the ground ore is fed to a gravity circuit that recovers about two-thirds of the gold which is then smelted on site to form dorÃ© bars.

## Extraction of Zinc 
The concentrated ore is finely ground into small pieces and then suspended in a rising stream of air. The sulphur content can be reduced hugely with this process. This also converts the Zinc Blende to ZnO which is way more reactive. The reaction occurring here is (2ZnS + 3O_{2} rightarrow 2ZnO + 2 SO_{2})
