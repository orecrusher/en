 · Additionally perlite has not been used for sewage sludge composting before. Furthermore previous studies have shown that mixing perlite with compost can produce high-quality plant cultivation substrate (Gattullo et al. 2017). Therefore the compost with perlite bulking agent has potential to be a plant cultivation substrate.

During processing raw perlite is superheated very rapidly to temperatures of 1560°F to 1650°F which causes the material to soften and the moisture inside the glass to turn to steam. As the trapped moisture inside bubbles trying to escape it expands the material from 7 to 16 times its original size — much like popcorn popping.

## How Much Perlite to Add to Potting Soil? 
In the private garden area perlite can be used primarily on soils that are difficult to retain moisture.This includes mainly sandy soils or those that are in areas that are not sufficiently covered by precipitation.In the case of very watering-intensive plants (deep-rooted plants) adding perlites can help to avoid damage caused by lack of water (especially on hot days).

## Perlite 
Perlite is an amorphous volcanic glass that has a relatively high water content typically formed by the hydration of obsidian.It occurs naturally and has the unusual property of greatly expanding when heated sufficiently. It is an industrial mineral suitable "as ceramic flux to lower the sintering temperature" and a commercial product useful for its low density after processing.

Perlite is one of nature's most versatile and efficient minerals. It is formed by molten rock—volcanic glass—processes that trap water into the perlite matrix over geologic time periods. When perlite ore is heated rapidly the volcanic glass softens causing the entrapped water molecules to turn to steam and expand the particles much like popcorn and it grows up to 20 times its size.

## Make The Most of Filter Aids 
 · Perlite has a lower specific weight than DE which allows less filter aid to be used. The primary advantage of perlite compared to DE is its relative purity. Diatomite may contaminate process liquids with dissolved salts and colloidal clays that are inherent to it; perlite doesn't share this risk.
