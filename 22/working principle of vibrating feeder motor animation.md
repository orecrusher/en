Working principle: The feeding process of vibratory feeders is achieved by the feeding chute doing linear reciproing vibration periodically which is forced by the special vibrating motor. When the vertical weight of the feeding chute vibration accelerated speed is bigger than the gravitational acceleration the material will be upthrown and jumped forward along a parabolic path.
