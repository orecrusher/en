 · Sometimes explosives up to 95978 kg are being detonated in a blast round in open-pit mine for speedy removal of overburden. The impact of 86 open-pit blasts has been documented in the underground openings and 258 blast vibration data has been recorded. The vibrations were recorded simultaneously in the roof sidewalls and at floor levels.

To measure ground vibration induced by blasting operations in open-pit mine peak particle velocity (PPV) is considered a standard criterion for evaluating the intensity of the ground vibration. More than 80% of the energy of explosives is released by generating ground vibrations that spread through the rock and soil to surrounding structures [ 2 3 ].

## Predicting Blast
In this study vibration sensors were used to measure blast-induced ground vibration (PPV). Different evolutionary algorithms were assessed for predicting PPV including the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm genetic algorithm (GA) imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) and artificial bee colony (ABC). These evolutionary algorithms were used to optimize the support vector

## Vibration response of the waste rock dump in open pit mine 
Vibration effect needs to be taken into account especially when the waste dump is situated in close distance to the seismic loading source. In the open pit mine near Jarnoltowek (Poland) phyllite is excavated and rock waste is deposited on the dump directly in the mine; that is at a distance of approximately 150 m from the quarry face.
