As the belt is fed on the tension at the roll tends to build up due to the weight of the belt on the slope. For this reason some method of braking is required. Customary practice is to use a belt clamp mounted on the conveyor structure through which the belt is threaded. Where the slope is very long additional clamps should be spaced

 · 4) Tension force on the belt is the main factor that influences longitudinal vibration: The effect of excitation frequency is smaller. This indies that more attention should be paid to controlling tensile loading in belt conveyor design. 5) Steel cord belts have the same response characteristic to shock excitation as an elastic body.
