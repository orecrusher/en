 · Surface mining is done in five ways: Strip mining – Strip mining is the most common surface mining method used to mine coal and lignite. The process is done by removing a strip of overburden before mining a seam of mineral. Strip mining is done only when the ore body is in close proximity to the surface. Open-pit mining – Open-pit mining is

## What is end point of manganese in pyrolusite ore 
 · The mining of manganese ores is usually done in open pits. Some ores are upgraded by washing and undersized ores can be agglomerated by sintering. Several processes have been developed for mining seafloor nodules but they cannot compete economically with the ready exploitation of high-grade terrestrial deposits.
