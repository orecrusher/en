## Gravel Mining — Spring Creek Coalition
Gravel Mining gravel mining is legal with the proper permits but it is not desirable in an Ozark stream. Studies conducted on Ozark streams in 1999 have shown that the hole in a stream caused by gravel removal causes the stream to move gravel from upstream into the hole eroding the bottom and banks of UPSTREAM neighbors.

## 1. IMPACTS OF SAND MINING 
Sand-and-gravel mining in stream channels can damage public and private property. Channel incision caused by gravel mining can undermine bridge piers and expose buried pipelines and other infrastructure. Several studies have documented the bed degradation caused by the two general forms of instream mining: (1) pit excavation and (2) bar skimming.

## The mining of sand a non
Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete for each tonne of cement the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS 2013b). Thus the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.
