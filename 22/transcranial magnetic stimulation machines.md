## What is Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (Deep TMS 
Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation also known as Deep TMS is a non-drug non-invasive yet effective treatment for depression patients.It is a type of brain stimulation technique where pulsed magnetic fields are generated by a coil placed on the scalp. This current essentially activates the neuronal circuits at the stimulation site resulting in symptom improvement.

## Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation 
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive treatment that delivers repetitive pulses of an MRI-strength magnetic field from a coil placed over the scalp. Powered by a rapidly pulsed current the magnetic field passes unimpeded through the skull and stimulates brain tissue beneath inducing currents that may help normalize activity in the area stimulated without
