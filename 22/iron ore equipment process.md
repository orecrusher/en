## Ironmaking Process 
 · Advantages of the HIsmelt process include direct injections of iron ore fines (hence no sinter no pellets) and crushed coal (cokemaking is eliminated) into the smelt reduction vessel and the use of a wide variety of possible feed materials including hematite ore fines (even those high in P) magnetite concentrate titano-magnetite ores noncoking coals and steel mill wastes.

## How iron is made 
Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 92-94% iron and 3-5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.

## Production 
To make iron from the ore it is reduced and melted in a blast furnace with coke at over 1300°C. The resulting pig iron contains more than 2% carbon and cannot be used for products in this form. It is only through the LD process that the pig iron is converted into steel by blowing it with pure oxygen.

## Metal Types and Recycling Process
 · Steel and iron are the most recycled materials in the world due in part to the opportunity to recover large structures as well as the ease of reprocessing. The use of magnets in the sorting process enables recyclers to easily separate them from the mixed waste stream. Currently the single most recycled container in the world is the aluminum can.
