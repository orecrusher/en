## Limestone Makes for Cleaner Coal
For older coal-fired power plants this included installing scrubber systems in the smokestacks to filter sulfur from the exhaust. "In 1985 Plains Electric built a power plant in nearby Prewitt New Mexico and the project manager needed a source for limestone that would pass the qualifiions required for the power plant emissions" he says.

Coal-fired boilers are mainly operated at either subcritical or supercritical conditions. From a thermo-physics perspective two phase mixtures of water and steam are replaced by a single supercritical fluid when the boiler pressure increases above the critical pressure of 22.12 MPa and the corresponding saturation temperature of 374 °C (Shen and Cheng 2004).
