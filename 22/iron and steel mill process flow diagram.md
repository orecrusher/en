 · The modern-day steel production process began in 1856 under a process known as the Bessemer process. It's largely considered to be the first process used to mass-produce steel. According to historians two different inventors one in the UK and one in Pittsburgh both simultaneously developed a steel production process that involved removing iron's impurities through the use of an air blast.
