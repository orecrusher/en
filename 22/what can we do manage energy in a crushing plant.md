## Energy considerations in compressive and impact crushing 
 · If it is so that impact or compressive crushing is a more energy efficient method than grinding it will be tempting to reduce the size as much as possible in the crushing circuit that precedes the mill. A common objective for a crushing plant is to maximise the tonnage of let us say −12.5 mm.
