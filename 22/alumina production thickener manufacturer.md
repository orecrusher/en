## Alumina Refining 
Alumina is produced from bauxite an ore that is mined from topsoil in various tropical and subtropical regions. The Bayer process discovered in 1887 is the primary process by which alumina is extracted from bauxite. To produce pure aluminum alumina is smelted using the Hall–Héroult electrolytic process.

Production. Aluminum does not exist in a pure state in nature. The production of primary aluminum metal begins with bauxite ore which is composed of hydrated aluminum oxide (40% to 60%) mixed with silica and iron oxide. It takes approximately 4 to 5 tonnes of bauxite ore to produce 2 tonnes of alumina.
