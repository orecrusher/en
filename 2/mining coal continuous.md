Andrew P. Schissler in Encyclopedia of Energy 2004 2.3 Strip Mining. Strip mining is employed in coal reserves where the overburden is removed in rectangular blocks in plan view called pits or strips. The pits are parallel and adjacent to each other. Strip mining is fundamentally different from contour or area mining on how the overburden is displaced called spoil handling.

Continuous mining is the most prevalent form of underground mining accounting for 56% of total underground production. In continuous mining a machine known as a continuous miner cuts the coal from the mining face obviating the need for drilling and blasting. Another type of continuous underground mining is called longwall mining.

Highwall miner – A highwall mining system consists of a remotely controlled continuous miner which extracts coal and conveys it via augers belt or chain conveyors to the outside. The cut is typically a rectangular horizontal cut from a highwall bench reaching depths of several hundred feet or deeper.
