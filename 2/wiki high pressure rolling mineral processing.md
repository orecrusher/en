Pressure leaching is the chemical dissolution of soluble minerals within a solid ore or concentrate carried out at elevated pressures and giving rise to a solution containing metals to be recovered. The process is carried out in closed autoclaves which permit higher temperatures (>220°C) and pressures (>20 atm) than are possible with open tanks.

In any particular metal rolling process it is important to understand how these deflections will affect the rolls and hence the work being rolled. The rolls initially start out flat. During a basic flat rolling operation it can be observed that the work material will exert greater force on the rolls towards the center of the material than at its edges.
