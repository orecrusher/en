## Leaching (chemistry) 
Leaching is the process of a solute becoming detached or extracted from its carrier substance by way of a solvent.. Leaching is a naturally occurring process which scientists have adapted for a variety of appliions with a variety of methods. Specific extraction methods depend on the soluble characteristics relative to the sorbent material such as concentration distribution nature and size.

 · The rate of leaching also depends on the total surface of the substrate. A decrease in the particle size means an increase in the total particle surface area so that higher yields of metal can be obtained without a change in the total mass of the particles. A particle size of about 42 μm is regarded as the optimum .

Effects of particle size and solution leaching on water retention behavior of ion-absorbed rare earth as well as action mechanism were investigated. Results demonstrate that given the same matric suction soil water content decreases gradually with the increase of particle size and content of coarse particles thus decreasing water retention capacity of soil accordingly.
