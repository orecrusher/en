## Selection of practical bench height in open pit mining 
Every bench in open pit mines composes a slope which its stability should be guaranteed to ensure safety of the entire pit. Today the factor of safety is the most common measure of slope stability and there is wide experience in its appliion to all types of geological conditions (Wyllie and Mah 2005). For open pit mines the factor of
