## Effects of aluminosilie minerals on copper–molybdenum 
 · Research highlights The effect of aluminosilie minerals on floatability of copper sulfides was evaluated and ways to decrease their unwanted effects tested. It was shown that ore types that contain muscovite and vermiculite have the greatest effect on the floatability of copper sulfides. A mixture of reagents as well as flotation at reduced pulp density can be used as solutions.

 · Flotation was the powerful new tool to which all refractory ores would respond. Time however has shown that flotation is no cure-all and there are poor as well as good ways of applying it. Coarse VS Fine Flotation. It is a very natural assumption upon the part of many people that the finer the particles are the easier it is to float them.

## Circular Economy in Tailings Management 
 · Most metal ores are processed by froth flotation. Sulfide tailings typically represent 80–98% of the weight and 150–170% of the volume of the mined ore. In underground mining it is feasible to use much of the tailings as backfill within galleries but in open pit mining all of the tailings are stored on the surface and often occupy a large land area.

Anyway focusing on Crushing+Sorting to get basic ores with crystallizing for higher ores will greatly simplify the Angel's side of thing because you basically don't need to make the more complex flotation setups at all (or at least not for a long time) and you get ores in a much more useful ratio you tend to need massively more iron and copper than other ore types.
