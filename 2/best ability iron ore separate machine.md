The idea which Edison's laboratory experimented with during the 1880s and 1890s was to use magnets to separate iron ore from unusable lower-grade ores. This would mean that abandoned mines could be profitable once again through the extraction of iron from sand at the sites. At the time iron ore prices had risen to unprecedented heights.

However iron ore is a mixture of iron and oxygen and other trace elements. To make steel the iron needs to be separated from the oxygen and a tiny amount of carbon needs to be added. Both are accomplished by melting the iron ore at a very high temperature (1700 degrees Celsius or over 3000 degrees Fahrenheit) in the presence of oxygen (from the air) and a type of coal called coke .
