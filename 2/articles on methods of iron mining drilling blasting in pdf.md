## Blast Hole Drilling: The Basic Process 
 · Blast hole drilling is traditionally used wherever the mining company wants to explore the mineral composition or potential mineral yield of the area demared for their mining interests. Blast holes are thus a fundamental step in the exploratory mining process and can be employed in both surface mining operations and underground mining operations to varying degrees with varying

## Types of Drilling Methods used in Mining 
Diamond drilling method is suitable for drilling at any angle to obtain cores of friable strata as well as the hardest rock. It has been adopted for drilling upto a depth of 3000 m and hole diameter upto 200 mm. Drilling upto such large depths is not required in coal mining areas where the maximum drilling depth is upto 1000 m as coal mines are rarely deeper than that.

 · Thus the success or failure of drill and blast methods cast a long shadow over the balance of the entire operations in mines. Rock drilling is performed by a number of tech- niques ranging from rotary/percussive drilling in very hard rock via rotary/crushing drilling in medium hard rock down to cutting in soft rock types.
