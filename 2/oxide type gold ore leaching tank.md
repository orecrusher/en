Cyanide will dissolve the gold from its host rock provided that the ore exists as an oxide and is not closely bound. In low-grade ore gold will exist in the form of microscopic particles and be processed via heap leaching. If the gold exists in a larger more concentrated state the ore will be finely ground and leached in a tank. A gold
