Uranium mining uses more water than some other types of mining and less than others. Uranium mines need to use water to get uranium from the ground. They use water to wash workers and mining equipment. Water is used to wet down dust so that it does not blow away. Water is also used in mining to help wash uranium out of the soil and rock.
