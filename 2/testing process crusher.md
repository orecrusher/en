## Dust Control or Prevention for Crushing and Screening 
Dust control for screening systems is similar to that for crushers although wet systems are generally not used due to blanking of the screen openings by the wet material. Screens should be totally enclosed and water suppression systems (when compatible with the process) or dust collection and exhaust systems should be incorporated.
