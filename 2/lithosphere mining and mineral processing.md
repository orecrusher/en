 · The less abundant elements often do not form minerals of their own but may replace the ion of a more abundant mineral in its crystal lattice. This is known as isomorphous replacement and it naturally depends on the relative ionic radii. Some ion pairs that undergo isomorphous replacement in minerals are K + and Ba 2 + Si 4 + and Ge 4 +.
