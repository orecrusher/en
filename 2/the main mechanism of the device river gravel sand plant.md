## Mechanical Dewatering 
Sand beds have been used for a great many years and are still the most cost-effective means of dewatering when land is available. The beds consist of tile drains in sand and gravel covered by about 26 cm (10 in) of sand. The sludge to be dewatered is poured on the sand. The water initially seeps into the sand and tile drains.

A disturbed balance in the uptake and composition of major nutrients is bound to influence the plant composition of micronutrients.

## Sand and Gravel 
Sand and Gravel. Sand and gravel deposits found on beaches or in rivers and streams are mostly quartz (silicon dioxide SiO 2) grains. Weathering of rocks such as granite forms these quartz grains. In the process of weathering the softer weaker minerals in granite (such as feldspar) are weathered away.

## An Introduction to Soil Concepts and the Role of Soils in 
 · If sandy soils are loosely-packed and of uniform size porosity is higher and therefore bulk density is lower than sandy soils with tightly-packed aggregates of different grain sizes. If a textural class has a bulk density reading that exceeds the growth-limiting factor for that class then conditions for plant life are not optimal.
