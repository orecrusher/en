## 13 Best Examples of Pure Substances [Simple Explanation 
 · Iron is rarely found in its elemental form on the Earth. However a few samples have been extracted from igneous rocks in Russia and Greenland. Pure iron is also created in labs in small quantities for limited purposes. In this artificial process iron pentacarbonyl is formed and heated to 250°C which ultimately decomposes into pure iron powder.

 · What is an impure metal? In metallurgy refining consists of purifying an impure metal. It is to be distinguished from other processes such as smelting and calcining in that those two involve a chemical change to the raw material whereas in refining the final material is usually identical chemically to the original one only it is purer.
