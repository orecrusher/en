## Solving Pump Inlet Problems 
pressure required lowers the inlet pressure below the vapor pressure of the liquid then vaporization and subsequent cavitation can occur. NPSHA calculations must be made including acceleration loss because inlet systems have positive pressure under steady state conditions that can go negative at the start of the pump's inlet stroke.
