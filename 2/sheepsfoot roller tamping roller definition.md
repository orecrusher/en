SPEED OF ROLLING Speed of rolling has a very important bearing on the roller output. The greater the speed of rolling the more the length of embankment that can be compacted in one day. Speed was found to be a significant factor for vibratory rollers because its number of vibrations per minute is not related to its forward speed.
