## Temperature Coefficient of Resistance
Resistance: Temperature CoefficientSince the electrical resistance of a conductor such as a copper wire is dependent upon collisional proccesses within the wire the resistance could be expected to increase with temperature since there will be more collisions and that is borne out by experiment. An intuitive approach to temperature dependence leads one to expect a fractional change in
