## How Many Tons Of Gravel Are In A Cubic Yard? 
Answer (1 of 7): The number of tons of gravel in a cubic yard depends on the density of the gravel. One ton is 2000 pounds.

Divide this by the density to give the number of cubic feet and then divide this figure by 27 to give the number of cubic yards.
