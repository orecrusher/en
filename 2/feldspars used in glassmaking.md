## What is Feldspar? (with pictures) 
Humans use it in pottery and glassmaking and it is also added to scouring powders and used as a filler in a wide range of products. Some are quite attractive leading people to use them as semi-precious gemstones as they can polish up quite nicely and feldspar is also used to make decorative accents on buildings and monuments.

## Feldspar: The Potter's Pet Rock 
 · Feldspars are minerals of varying composition commonly used by potters. Feldspars form a glassy white surface when fired high enough. They have a very long range they begin melting at cone 4 and continue fusing beyond cone 10. They also tend to stiffen a glaze due to their high alumina content. In ceramics there are two basic egories of feldspars: potash feldspars in which the primary

## Feldspars Used In Glassmaking
Potassium feldspar is commonly used as a flux in glassmaking and ceramics. Flux is a material that's added to a solid to lower the solid's melting point. The flux is a vital component of most glass and ceramic production because it helps control the viscosity of the glass and helps create a glassy phase in ceramics at low temperatures.
