## What is Diatomite? 
Diatomite is a near pure sedimentary deposit consisting almost entirely of silica. The Greeks first used diatomite over 2000 years ago in pottery and brick. There are many diatomite deposits throughout the world but those of high-purity which are commercially viable are rare. The properties which make diatomite valuable include low density

## Thread milling 
Thread milling produces threads with the circular ramping movement of a rotating tool. The lateral movement of the tool in one revolution creates the thread pitch. Although not as widely used as thread turning thread milling achieves high productivity in certain appliions. You do not want to risk tap breakage on expensive parts – thread

 · Understanding the Process of 5-Axis Machining. Many of you might have had some experience with 5-axis machining but for those new to the technology let's break it down. A machine that is capable of 5-axis design can move the toolpath in the X Y and Z directions as well as rotate in the A and B (or C) axes – thus the term 5-axis machining.

Machining is a process in which a material (often metal) is cut to a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The processes that have this common theme are collectively called subtractive manufacturing in contrast to additive manufacturing which uses controlled addition of material.Exactly what the "controlled" part of the definition implies can vary but it
