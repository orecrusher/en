## Quarry Design
Design Process Although the nature of quarry design may be profoundly different from site to site the process by which it has been arrived at and the various elements should be clearly laid out in the Health and Safety documentation. Good practice would ensure a named individual is responsible for the maintenance of the design.

## Quarry excavation design and safe working practices
 · The quarry design should incorporate the quarry layout extraction methods and operating procedures. This should include the required procedures to ensure the safety of all people within or around the site including the methods that will be used to stabilise slopes protect against rockfall and to prevent the risk of falls of persons.
