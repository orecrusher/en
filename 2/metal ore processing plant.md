## Production 
From the primary raw material ore liquid pig iron is produced in the sintering plant and then in the blast furnace which is then converted into steel in the steelworks using the LD process. Steel is highly recyclable and can be turned into new products in several cycles using an electric arc furnace in which scrap is melted down with electricity.
