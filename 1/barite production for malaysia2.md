## Mineral Notes: Barite • Snowden
 · World barite production essentially follows oil and gas-well drilling activity. Annual production increased from around 6 Mt in the late 1990s to peak at around 9 Mt in 2012 before declining to just over 7 Mt in 2016. Production has since recovered due to increased oil prices and hence exploration activity – reaching an estimated 9.5 Mt in 2018.
