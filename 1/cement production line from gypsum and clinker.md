## What is Cement Clinker? Composition Types Uses 
Clinker is a nodular material produced in the kilning stage during the production of cement and is used as the binder in many cement products. The lumps or nodules of clinker are usually of diameter 3-25 mm and dark grey in color. It is produced by heating limestone and clay to the point of liquefaction at about 1400°C-1500°C in the rotary kiln.

Gypsum plays a crucial role in cement. Though it is used in a small quantity in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent in terms of SO3 gypsum's role in cement is significant more predominantly at early ages.

## Cement Production: From Clinker Production to the End Product
4. Cement production. The clinker is processed into different types of cement. Apart from gypsum and clinker various additives such as slag sand trass and fly ash are also ground up with them depending on the type of cement required. The MULTIDOS® weighfeeder feeds material into the mill similar to the earlier feeding into the raw mill.

## Evaluating the Thermal Stability of Mercury and Other 
As shown in Table 1-1 fly ash and FGD gypsum are used in the production of cement clinker. According to the ACAA 3.2 million tons of fly ash and 0.4 million tons of FGD gypsum are used in the production of cement clinker. For wallboard production only FGD gypsum (and not fly ash) is used which avoids the need for mining natural gypsum.
