## Introduction to the milling technology with the bead mill 
Introduction to the milling technology with the bead mill DISPERMAT SL. 1. Function and task of the bead mill. In many technical processes it is necessary to divide solid material into fine particles and distribute them evenly within a liquid carrier. This process is generally known as "dispersion". During dispersion the adhesive forces

## Profile milling 
Profile milling covers multi-axis milling of convex and concave shapes in two and three dimensions. The larger the component and the more complied the configuration to the machine the more important the profile milling process planning becomes. The machining process should be divided into at least three operation types: Roughing/semi-roughing.

## Very basic milling question about depth of cut 
 · The max depth you should use in a slot cut is the diameter of the end mill so for a 1/4" OD end mill you can cut 1/4" deep at a time. If you need to go deeper then make multiple passes. The max axial depth of cut meaning the max amount of the end mill that is touching the work when doing profiling cuts is 1-1/2 the diameter of the end mill.

## Ball Milling 
Ball milling is a size reduction technique that uses media in a rotating cylindrical chamber to mill materials to a fine powder. As the chamber rotates the media is lifted up on the rising side and then cascades down from near the top of the chamber. With this motion the particles in between the media and chamber walls are reduced in size by

## Milling Process Defects Equipment 
End milling - An end mill makes either peripheral or slot cuts determined by the step-over distance across the workpiece in order to machine a specified feature such as a profile slot pocket or even a complex surface contour.The depth of the feature may be machined in a single pass or may be reached by machining at a smaller axial depth of cut and making multiple passes.
