## Gold extraction 
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution mineral processing hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.. Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing resulting in direct recovery of

Gold Mine and the Ore Processing and Beneficiation Plant. The Ganajur Main Gold project is an open-pit mining operation with processing of ore as an integral part of the mines as the ore could not be sold in the market. The ore mined out from the mines will be sent to processing plant where the ore will be finely ground to recover gold.

 · Processing. Ore extracted from Super Pit is treated in two processing plants – the Fimiston plant and the Gidji Roaster plant. The processing involves crushing the ore before it is sent to a gravity circuit that recovers free gold hosted in high grade lodes. Free gold undergoes floatation to produce an auriferous pyrite concentrate.

 · You can remove the most common metals found in gold ore (copper zinc and lead) using elements that bond with oxygen at lower temperatures than gold. This oxidation process will make copper oxide zinc oxide and lead oxide — all of which are less dense than pure gold and will float to the top of your crucible allowing the slag to be sloughed off.
