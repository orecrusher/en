## Iron Ore Mining 
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## Raw materials 
There are several iron ore mines in the world so we get the iron ore to produce iron. The iron ore is basically iron oxide but this is not a pure chemical it contains certain levels of impurities and through the iron making process the oxygen from iron ore must be taken out. This is done by carbon. Carbon is contained in coke. Coke is also

## Steelmaking 
 · Smelting reduction employs two units: in the first iron ore is heated and reduced by gases exiting from the second unit which is a smelter-gasifier supplied with coal and oxygen. The partially reduced ore is then smelted in the second unit and liquid iron is produced.

## Steel making process – ArcelorMittal
There are two main processes for producing steel: by means of a blast furnace (= indirect reduction) in combination with a converter or by means of an electric furnace. In the former process iron ore is the main raw material. In an electric furnace scrap iron is used and occasionally also sponge iron.
