In essence a disc stack separator is a settling tank whose base is wrapped around the center line of the bowl. Rapid rotation of separator bowl means that the effect of gravity is replaced by a controllable centrifugal force or gravitational force known as G-force that can have an effect up to 10000 times greater than the force of gravity.

The bowl discs Purifier and clarifier bowls each contain a stack of conical discs. The discs may number up to 150 and are separated from one another by a small gap. Separation of impurities and water from the oil takes place between these discs. A series of aligned holes near the outside edge permits entry of the dirty oil.

How it works Separation takes place in a rotating solid-wall bowl. Centrifugal force pushes water and solid particles outwards. Water collects in the seal which drains into a channel underneath. Solids accumulate on the bowl wall and are easy to remove by hand. Clean oil flows inwards and up to the paring disc.

More modern centrifuges are self-cleaning allowing a continuous separation/clarifiion process. This type of centrifuge consists of a specially constructed bowl with peripheral discharge slots. These slots are kept closed under pressure. With a momentary release of pressure for about 0.15 s the contents of sediment space are evacuated.

A three-way changeover valve directs the waste oil to the separation stage. The separator bowl has a disc stack an oil paring disc and a water paring disc. The disc stack rotates at high speed so solids accumulate at the bowl's periphery. Our patented XCavator device continuously discharges the solids into a container under the separator.
