A co-extraction coefficient (k) was put forward to evaluate comprehensively co-extraction extent in different solutions. In the crystallization stage 68.2% of aluminum can be removed

## Separation factor of shaking table for vanadium pre 
Separation factor of shaking table for vanadium pre-concentration was intensively investigated to search for the dominant factor making vanadium-bearing particles separated from stone coal. The density factor was not the main reason for vanadium pre-concentration only assisting the separation in the roughing and scavenging stage. The granularity factor had nearly no effect on the separation.

Coal was used commercially by the Chinese long before it was used in Europe. Although no authentic record is available coal from the Fushun mine in northeastern China may have been employed to smelt copper as early as 1000 bce. Stones used as fuel were said to have been produced in China during the Han dynasty (206 bce –220 ce).
