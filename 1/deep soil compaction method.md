## Deep ripping for soil compaction 
Deep ripping mechanically breaks up compacted soil layers however care must be taken to ensure results are effective. Deep ripping uses strong tines working down to 35-50cm depth to loosen hard layers of soil. Tine spacing working depth shallow leading tines or discs soil moisture content timing and soil type all need to be taken into account.

Method includes dynamic impact at soil in place indied on plan first by deep explosion of explosive charge placed in well or by electric discharge produced by installation spark gap of which is placed in well and then by rammer strokes on soil in place indied on plan with provision of crater on soil surface which is periodically filled by draining material of compaction.

## METHOD OF TEST FOR RELATIVE COMPACTION OF UNTREATED 
This test method describes the procedure used to determine the relative compaction of untreated and treated soils and aggregates. Relative compaction in this method is defined as the ratio of the in-place wet density of a soil or aggregate to the test maximum wet density of the same soil or aggregate when compacted by a specific test method.
