Zeolite does not have a linear adsorption curve. In other words adsorption capacity is not reduced greatly for low VOC concentrations. It is thus more suitable for working with low end concentrations than activated carbon or polymer. Zeolites can be obtained with pore sizes between 0.3 – 3 nm. This pore size is uniform for one type of zeolite.

Zeolite is a silica-based volcanic ash (sand-like mineral) that forms over time. Zeolite is an alkaline mineral that is very porous and has a negative charge. Since most toxins such as heavy metals radiation and pesticides are positively charged zeolite is pulled to the toxins like a magnet and sucks them up into its structure.

 · The zeolite system was able to adsorb significant amounts of ammonia up to 0.75 mmol/g at 50 °C; in line with the exothermicity of the adsorption process the storage capacity decreased on increasing the adsorption temperature but values close to 0.4 mmol/g were still measured at 200. °C.. Similar experiments over the core monolith zeolite (open symbols) provided results in good

 · As can be seen from oxide composition analysis of the synthesis zeolite the silicon oxide percent by weight is much higher than the others and the inpurity responsible metal oxides (Fe 2 O 3 TiO 2 .) are low in percent by weight. This shows that the synthesized zeolite is pure and has a potencial capacity for hardness adsorpition.
