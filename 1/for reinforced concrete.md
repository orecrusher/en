## Advantages and Disadvantages of Reinforced Concrete 
Reinforced concrete is a combination of traditional cement concrete with reinforcements (steel bar). This combination is made to utilize the compressive strength of concrete and tensile strength of steel simultaneously.. In reinforced concrete the components work together to resist many types of loading.

## Reinforced Concrete Design 
Reinforced concrete is a composite material and the average density is considered to be 150 lb/ft3. It has the properties that it will creep (deformation with long term load) and shrink (a result of hydration) that must be considered. Plane sections of composite materials can still

## Macrofiber Concrete Reinforcement 
Macrofiber concrete reinforcement is achieved by adding macrofibers with superior bonding properties to the concrete matrix. The result is crack control and an extended service life of the concrete. Synthetic macrofibers are manufactured from a proprietary blend of polypropylene resins in compliance with ASTM C 1116/C 1116M.

## Concrete and reinforced concrete 
 · Reinforced concrete is more likely to be used in tension which is why it has those steel reinforcing "rebars" inside. But as we've already seen it can still crack unless it's prestressed. Modern concrete fails through what's informally known as concrete cancer or concrete disease which involves three interrelated problems.

## reinforcement in concrete Topic
 · Most concrete used for construction is a combination of concrete and reinforcement that is called reinforced concrete. Reinforcement for concrete is provided by embedding deformed steel bars or welded wire fabric within freshly made concrete at the time of casting. The purpose of reinforcement is to provide additional strength for concrete where it is needed.
