## Iron Ore Beneficiation Process Gravity Concentration Magneti
 · 04/10/2018 Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849 a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

## Iron Processing 
Our heavy-duty iron ore balling drums are relied on by some of the industry's top producers to process iron ore fines into pellets for the steelmaking process. The use of a disc pelletizer is a popular alternative approach to pelletizing iron ore fines as this offers more control over pellet size and produces a more refined pellet product.

 · Iron ore was won by drilling and blasting ().As mining technology generally developed so did drilling techniques and the explosives used. Smith (1990) reported that the Cleveland deposit was associated with a very strong stone roof rock (known as "dogger") allowing mine drivages to be self-supporting. However he states that in later years where the mining had progressed to the dip this

## Iron Ore Mining 
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
