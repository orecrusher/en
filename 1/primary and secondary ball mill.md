The High Energy Ball Mill Emax and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input. The innovative design of both the mills and the grinding jars allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time - with only minor warming effects. These ball mills are also suitable for mechano chemistry.
