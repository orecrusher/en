## Beneficiation and mineral processing of bauxite and feldspar
 · 4) BAUXITE Introduction Although aluminium (Al) is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust and the 3rd most abundant element it occurs mainly in combinations that so far have defined commercial extraction. It is an important constituent of all clays and soil and of the silies of common rocks. Alumina (Al2O3) is produced worldwide for

## PRODUCTION OF ALUMINA FROM OUSE BAUXITE.
Considerable bauxite deposits were discovered in Tasmania towards the end of 1941. The purpose of this investigation was to carry out analyses of representative samples from the Ouse and Swansea deposits and to discover to what extent the Bayer Process was suitable for the extraction of alumina from the Ouse bauxite.

A typical Bayer plant generates from 1 to 2.5 times as much red mud as alumina produced with an average of 1.75 tonnes of red mud per tonne of alumina (this ratio is dependent on the type of bauxite used in the refining process and the extraction conditions).

The cleaning solutions that work best for red clay stains are: Rub liquid dish-washing detergent onto the stain and allow it to sit overnight. Create a paste of equal parts powdered dishwasher detergent and water. Apply the paste to the stain and allow it to sit for three hours. Apply a liquid oil soap to the stain and let it sit for 15 minutes.
