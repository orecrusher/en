Concentration of Gold Ores a Key to Reducing Mercury Use in Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining. Posted 3rd e 2012 by Kevin Telmer. In artisanal gold mining mercury is essentially used to concentrate the gold. It does this by bonding with the gold to form a heavy amalgam that is then easily separated from the other minerals.
