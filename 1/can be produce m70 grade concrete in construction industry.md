OPC is a basic type of cement consisting of the Bogue's components in the above proportions to gain the desired strength in 28 days. The different grades of Ordinary Portland cement are 33 grade 43 grade and 53 grade. The OPC 33 grade of cement will gain 33 MPa in 28 days and so on.

 · When it comes to constructing houses complexes or roads 53-grade cement is a sheer waste of resources. The compressive strength of PPC after 28 days can match that of 53-grade. This is the best kind of cement to use in hydraulic or marine structures for mass construction and can also replace OPC completely because PPC is best under aggressive conditions.
