Many of the particles encountered in mining are characterized by sieves (classifiers). Recent advances in computers cameras and software make image analysis practical for samples with sizes larger than several microns in diameter. As particle size decreases sieving and/or dynamic image analysis becomes more arduous or impossible and laser diffraction becomes the technique of choice.
