## Coal Mining in Indonesia 
The Indonesian coal industry is rather fragmented with only a few big producers and many small players that own coal mines and coal mine concessions (mainly in Sumatra and Kalimantan). Since the early 1990s when the coal mining sector was reopened for foreign investment Indonesia witnessed a robust increase in coal production coal exports and domestic sales of coal.

Coal usage and production chains. Coal is an important resource obtained either from charcoal kilns or coal mines. Coal mines are twice as productive and don't lower the attractiveness of an island so coal mines should be a primary source of coal and charcoal kilns should be used only to make up for not having enough coal deposits.. In the beginning coal is used to produce steel beams and weapons.

## Machines Used in Coal Mining 
 · Coal mining has been performed since the arrival of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-18th century. Coal is used as a fuel primarily for steam-generated electrical power plants as well as being a component of certain industrial appliions such as steel manufacturing.

## The Most Dangerous Gases In Mining: Damp Gases 
In coal mines large quantities of CO is generated during the oxidation of coal and during mine fires or explosions. It will then be present in what miners call afterdamp - the resulting noxious gases given off by these fires explosions or blasting.

## Ventilation 
A few mines do use intake or "forcing" fans particularly in the US where exhaust adits are mined to outcrops. The roadways underground are divided into 2 groups those carrying fresh air into the workings ("intake airways") and those carrying used air back out ("return airways").

## Types of Coal Mining 
When a coal seam is too deep to efficiently mine the coal from the surface underground mining techniques are used. The underground method of coal mining currently utilizes two main techniques: room and pillar mining and longwall mining 1. Room and pillar mining involves cutting a system of rooms within the coal seem.

## Managing water consumption in mining
 · Mining uses water primarily for mineral processing dust suppression slurry transport and employees' needs. In most mining operations water is sought from groundwater streams rivers and lakes or through commercial water service suppliers. But often mine sites are loed in areas where water is already scarce and understandably local
