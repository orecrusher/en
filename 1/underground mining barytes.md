 · Underground Mines Are Extremely Deep. Generally every mine is deep but underground mines are much more profound than surface mines. Surface mines can not go lower than 200 feet into the Earth but with subterranean mining it goes deeper than that. Most underground mines reach depths of approximately 2500 feet.

## What is Underground Mining? (with pictures)
Underground mining is a technique used to access ores and valuable minerals in the ground by digging into the ground to extract them. This is in contrast with techniques like open pit mining in which the surface layers of ground are scooped away to access deposits or mountaintop removal in which the top of a mountain is simply shaved off to access the ore inside.
