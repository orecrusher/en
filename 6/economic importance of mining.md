As economists are fond of saying: "There is no such thing as a free lunch" meaning costs are almost always present and have to be considered in any rational decision.

## THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF GOLD MINING
Experience demonstrates that the benefits of mining also extend well beyond the mine site. In established economies for every job at the mine twice as many people are employed indirectly –working for suppliers and enterprises that support the mine. So it's not surprising that 70% of the total expenditures by gold mining companies go toward payments to suppliers contractors and employees.

 · In short term it accelerates economic growth. In long term it causes environmental degradation Mining offers some jobs. But mines when they are retired are nonrenewable sources. Miners are happy as long as they work. When a mining operation ends they loose their jobs (if mine is a local and limited). Most mining operations degrade environment.
