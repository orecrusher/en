## Sludge Thickening 
Extremely dilute sludge delivered by the water line (usually 99 to 99.8% water)is concentrated to produce sludge containing 90 to 96% water. This sludge is still fluid and therefore can be pumped out. Thickening constitutes an additional investment cost and a source of possible nuisances.
