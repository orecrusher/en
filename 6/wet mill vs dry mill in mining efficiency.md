## SHOTCRETE: WET PROCESS VERSUS DRY PROCESS
the dry-mix process involves blowing powder through a hose and adding water at the nozzle; wet-mix involves pumping already mixed material to the nozzle (Fig. 2). The main difference between the two processes is the point at which the water is added. Compressed air is introduced at the nozzle during the wet-mix process to enhance the

## Wet milling 
Wet milling Wet milling with IKA's inline machines is a safe and efficient alternative to dry grinding. Dry grinding creates a lot of dust which causes the need for proper filtering systems. This can be of particular importance during grinding of substances whose dust when mixed with aerial oxygen can result in explosive mixtures.

## Grinding 
The ball mill is the fine grinding machine connect the SAG or AG mill and flotation machine. Ball mills produce fine particles with a uniform size for flotation its grinding medias commonly are steel ball. The ball mill rolls grinding media together with the ore as the ore grinds these balls initially 5-10 cm in diameter but gradually wear out.

Wet vs. dry As a rule of thumb operations look to reduce drying requirements for obvious cost impliions. Employing wet magnetic separation early in a process can greatly benefit an operation if a low-grade final tailing or a clean marketable product can be produced since it alleviates both drying and dry storage costs.
