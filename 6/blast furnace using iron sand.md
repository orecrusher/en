In this method iron is reduced in its solid state using either coal or natural gas as a fuel. One advantage of this method is that iron can be added as lumps pellets or fines and if coal is used it does not need to be coked.

## Iron Making 
Blast furnace is a reactor to produce iron. Ore reaches molten state and gets separated physically due to density from gangue and impurities. Presence of excess carbon reduces the melting point of iron to 1150oC. Integrated Steel Plants refer to Liquid Iron as Hot metal Pig Iron - allusion to suckling Pigs in Sand molds of a cast floor.

## What metals are extracted using a blast furnace?
 · The blast furnace Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.
