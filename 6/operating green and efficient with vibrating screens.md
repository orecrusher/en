## FINGER
The FINGER-SCREEN™ vibratory screener is a patented non-binding design concept for resource recovery. Our vibratory screeners can be used to separate materials by size removing small particles from large objects. This process makes it easy for sizing and classifying a wide variety of materials completing the work of several people in a reduced amount of time.

The efficiency of a screening operation may be evaluated by simple mass balances over screen. Consider that the feed to a screen consists of materials A and B where A is the oversize and B is the undersize material. Out of the total materials fed to the screen some part of it is removed as overflow and remaining part is collected as underflow.

Screening can very easily be viewed as the most important operation in the processing plant. If the screen is only operating at 75% efficiency then 25% of the desired product is going somewhere else. The performance of a screen is affected by four variables: eccentric throw frequency (rpm) angle of adjustment and throw direction.
