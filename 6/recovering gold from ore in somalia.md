## From Tailings to Treasure? Miners Make Money 
 · DRD Gold extracted 33600 ounces of gold worth nearly US$40 million in the last quarter of 2013. Mintails a mine tailings processor has developed new technology to process 350000 tons of slimes from its extensive tailings resources. It expects to recover 58 kg of gold per month and has enough slimes to last until 2025.
