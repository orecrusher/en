Concrete has relatively high compressive strength (it doesn't crack under weight) but significantly lower tensile strength (it cracks when being pulled). The compressive strength is typically controlled with the ratio of water to cement when forming the concrete and tensile strength is increased by additives typically steel to create reinforced concrete.

## Tensile Strength of Cement 
 · Importance: Cement is usually subjected to compressive stresses when used in the form of concrete or mortar. The most comprehensive test for cement or for a mixture of it with sand is done by determining its crushing strength.Unfortunately it requires a very costly machine and therefore the usual practice is to use the tensile test instead which can be carried out very cheaply.

High-Strength Concrete. In the early 1970s experts predicted that the practical limit of ready-mixed concrete would be unlikely to exceed a compressive strength greater than 11000 pounds square inch (psi). Over the past two decades the development of high-strength concrete has enabled builders to easily meet and surpass this estimate.

Everything You Need to Know About Concrete Strength 8 mins read. Mar 31 2019 Tensile strength is the ability of concrete to resist breaking or cracking under tension. It affects the size of cracks in concrete structures and the extent to which they occur. Cracks occur when tensile forces exceed the tensile strength of the concrete.
