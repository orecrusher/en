## Going Down with the Ship: It's Aeration Not Suction 
 · Bottom line I think there is a really big quantitative difference in the amount of air being injected into an aquarium vs. air escaping from the submerged hull of a ship. Our ability to swim/float depends on the density of the medium and water that is essentially foam due to aeration is impossible to swim or float in. Thanks for stopping by.
