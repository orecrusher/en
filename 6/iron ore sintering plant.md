The cheapest supply of iron ore to a steelmaker's furnace is most often the sintered iron ore fines produced from their own or others sinter plants. Sintering takes the iron ore fines and agglomerates them into strong lumps capable of being used in the furnace. It also concentrates the iron percentage being supplied to the furnace.
