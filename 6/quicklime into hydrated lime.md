 · For all practical purposes there are three states in which lime ( CaO ) is commonly encountered. 1. QUICKLIME = Produced by strongly heating limestone to form CalciumOxide. : It has the appearance of irregular white lumps. 2. SLAKED LIME = Calcium Hydroxide. : This chemical is the product of Quicklime + Water its a dry white powder.

## Differences between Hydrated lime and quicklime 
 · The main differences between hydrated lime and quicklime are their reactivity their chemical composition. Hydrated lime and quicklime are both calcium compounds. In its hydrated state calcium is called calcium hydroxide and in its pure state it is called calcium oxide or quicklime.. Calcium oxide has a heavy density (65lb/ft³) and is more reactive than hydrated lime.

## Advanced Water Treatment Concepts
Quicklime (in pellet form) must first be slaked or mixed with water then heated to turn it into hydrated lime before use. When quicklime is mixed with water there is a potential for explosions due to the heat released from the chemical combinations. Lime also has reactions with alum and ferric sulfates so direct mixing should be avoided.

both quicklime and hydrated lime are slightly soluble in water but calcium carbonate is hardly soluble at all. So washing a small quantity (say 5 to 10 grammes) with excess warm sugar solution (the sugar helps the lime to dissolve quicker) for a few minutes would allow quick or hydrated lime to dissolve away.

The quicklime neutralizes the acidic oxides SiO 2 Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3 to produce a basic molten slag. Ground quicklime is used in the production of aerated concrete blocks with densities of ca. 0.6–1.0 g/cm 3 (9.8–16.4 g/cu in). Quicklime and hydrated lime can considerably increase the load carrying capacity of clay-containing soils.
