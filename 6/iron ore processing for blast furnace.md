 · First the iron ore the raw materials for steel comes from the Earth. Most iron ores — hematite magnetite limonite — contain an average of 60% of iron (Fe). Before the iron ores enter a blast furnace it undergoes 'sintering' which turns the pristine iron ore into more compact and appropriate sizes.

 · How is iron ore reduced in the blast furnace? hii friend here is your answer Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron oxide. The oxygen must be removed from the iron oxide to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

In nature iron occurs as ore. In mining the ore is extracted from the rock and processed. To make iron from the ore it is reduced and melted in a blast furnace with coke at over 1300°C. The resulting pig iron contains more than 2% carbon and cannot be used for products in this form.

In the integrated steelmaking route iron ore containing ferrous oxides is converted to metallic iron inside the blast furnace via a chemical process called 'reduction'. Coal in the form of metallurgical coal and pulverised coal act as the active agents or 'reductants' that strip away oxygen from the iron ore to yield metallic iron.

## How is iron extracted using a blast furnace?
 · Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions. See further detail related to it here.
