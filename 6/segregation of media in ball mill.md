Tower Mills require a settlement zone at the top to separate the media from the slurry – this limits the agitation speed to a tip speed of 3m/s (compared to IsaMill™ at 21-23m/s) and therefore limits the energy intensity while ball mills can only have a relatively low amount of ball loading before media empties from the mill.

Media to media contact for rods mills is linear rather than point to point (as with balls) and are much heavier. The larger feed tends to separate rods at the feed end such that larger particles are preferentially abraded.

## A Review of Breakage Behavior in Fine Grinding by Stirred 
Mill performance and energy efficiency are discussed in the context of mill mechanics as related to mill power material transport and flow and particle breakage mechanisms. The development and adaptation of general size-mass balance models to fine grinding in stirred-media mills is evaluated.

## Variables in Ball Mill Operation 
In ball milling of dry solids the main independent variables are mill diameter mill speed media size solids loading and residence time. For most companies the production mill already exists so we can ignore mill diameter and focus on the other variables. Mill Speed is one variable that can often be easily changed with a variable frequency

Ball milling is a grinding technique that uses media to effectively break down pigment agglomerates and aggregates to their primary particles. Using a rotor or disc impeller to create collisions of the grinding media the impact and force created by the bead mills collisions break down the pigment agglomerates.
