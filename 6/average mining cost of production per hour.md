## 3. CALCULATION OF MACHINE RATES
3.1 Introduction. The unit cost of logging or road construction is essentially derived by dividing cost by production. In its simplest case if you rented a tractor with operator for $60 per hour - including all fuel and other costs - and you excavated 100 cubic meters per hour your unit cost for excavation would be $0.60 per cubic meter.

## How Long To Mine 1 Ethereum in 2020? 
 · To mine 1 Ethereum you require a rig with a hash rate of 15500 megahash a second or mh/s. This is the speed of your mining rig. To build a mining rig with such a high hash rate you require more than 50 GPUs which would cost you more than $100000. The power consumption of this mining rig would also cost the same amount.
