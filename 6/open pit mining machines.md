## South Africa's Biggest Open Pit Mines 
 · Open pit mining - also called open cut mining or open cast mining - is a surface mining technique used to extract rocks and minerals. It requires large-scale equipment including shovels and drills. Motor graders also play a role maintaining haulage roads so that both equipment and mined material can be transported to and from the mines.

## The Environmental Impact of Mining (Different Mining 
 · Underground mining where miners tunnel beneath the Earth's surface to extract mineral deposits is rarer than open-pit mining. In 2014 it made up about 5% of all American mining operations — and has less of an impact on the surface. However this doesn't mean that underground mining doesn't have an effect on the environment.
