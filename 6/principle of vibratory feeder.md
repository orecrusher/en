## Vibrating feeder 
A vibratory feeder is an instrument that uses vibration to "feed" material to a process or machine.Vibratory feeders use both vibration and gravity to move material. Gravity is used to determine the direction either down or down and to a side and then vibration is used to move the material.

## Vibratory Feeder Working Principle 
A basic vibratory feeder consists of a trough supported by springs hinged links or other force-dampening mechanical components. These isolate the vibratory feeder from the structural members of the building which can cause unwanted reaction forces. Attached to the trough is a drive unit that produces high frequency low amplitude oscillations.
