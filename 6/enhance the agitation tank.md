Surface agitation in CO2 injected planted tanks - The 2Hr Gaseous exchange restores a tank's dissolved gas levels to match those of atmospheric levels in line with gas pressure physics. For aquarist purposes this means matching replenishing depleted oxygen levels in the tank as well as off gassing CO2 from the tank water if it is at an elevated level compared to equilibrium.
