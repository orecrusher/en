## Steel manufacture 
Modern iron making. Iron is manufactured in a blast furnace. First iron ore is mixed with coke and heated to form an iron-rich clinker called 'sinter'. Sintering is an important part of the overall process as it reduces waste and provides an efficient raw material for iron making. Coke is produced from carefully selected grades of coal.

Sintered iron ore and coke are layered inside a 100 m long furnace then hot air at 1200 degree Celsius is blown into the blast furnace from the bottom causing the coal to burn and this heat in turn burns the iron ore to create molten iron at a temperature of 1500 degree Celsius. This is also called hot metal (pig iron) in the industry.

Workington started out as a fishing village. Its docks were developed to allow the export of locally-mined coal. In the 19th century an iron industry developed around the mining of haematite iron ore in the area and it was the presence of haematite that led to the river-side development of the steelworks — haematite proved suitable for the new steelmaking processes.
