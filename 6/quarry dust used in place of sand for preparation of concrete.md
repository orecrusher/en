 · Crushed stone: If you hear the generic "crushed stone" term it usually refers to stone that has a mixture of stone dust in it. This type of stone is best used for a base when heavy compaction is needed. As a result it is typically used for the base of concrete and paving projects foundations of structures and driveway bases.

## Behaviour Of Concrete On The Use Of Quarry Dust To Replace 
Attempts have been made to study the suitability of Quarry dust as sand replacing material and it has been found that Quarry dust improves the mechanical properties of concrete as well as elastic modulus. This present work is an attempt to use Quarry Dust as partial replacement for Sand in concrete.

## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete 
The percentage passing 150 microns of manufactured sand is relaxed to 20% (while that of natural sand is limited to 10%). As per design and economics crushed sand can be used to partially or fully replace river sand from a concrete mix. The Availability of crushed sand is not a concern as it can be manufactured from rocks in any season.

## Manufactured Sand (M
The control over these physical properties of manufacturing sand make the concrete require less amount of water and provide higher workable concrete. The less use of water also helps in increasing the strength of concrete less effort for mixing and placement of concrete and thus increases productivity of construction activities at site.

 · The sand - "concrete sand" is where the interlock takes place - it comes up and fills the joints causing them to lock up. Stone dust will only get hard "under" the pavers and actually hold water which is another issue. Use concrete sand and only 3/4" under the pavers. Just make sure the base is deep enough and compacted.

Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete for each tonne of cement the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS 2013b). Thus the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.
