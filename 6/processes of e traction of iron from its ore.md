## Innovations: How Hydrometallurgy and the SX/EW Process 
The SX/EW process itself has very little environmental impact because its liquid streams are very easily contained There is no effluent inasmuch as all impurities are returned to the site where they originated and the sulfuric acid is eventually neutralized by the limestone in the ore body or waste dump where it is deposited as calcium sulfate (gypsum) - a very insoluble substance.
