## Research On One Borehole Hydraulic Coal Mining System
The borehole hydraulic coal mining system was demonstrated to be a feasible method for hydraulic mining Xia et al. 2008. The method involves fragmenting coal seams by high-pressure water jet and removing coal slump through a drilled hole by hydraulic or airlifting methods.

The Borehole Hydraulic Coal Mining System (BHCMS) causes fragmentation of coal seams and removes coal slump through a drilled hole using high-pressured water jet. Then the mixture of coal and water as slurry are driven out of the borehole by hydraulic or air-lifting method and are separated at the surface. This paper presents a case study of hydraulic borehole coal mining.
