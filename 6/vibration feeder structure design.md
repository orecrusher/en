7. The minimum length of the feeder is determined by projecting the angle of repose for the specific material from the gate point (see illustration titled "Ideal Hopper Design") to the feeder pan and adding 4 to 6 inches to prevent a free flow condition. 8. The feeder must not contact any adjacent structure because it must be free to vibrate.

Variable Force counterweight control alters the exciting force by varying only the counterweight effect rather than the motor speed. As air or hydraulic pressure signal varies from zero to maximum the unbalanced forces vary proportionally.
