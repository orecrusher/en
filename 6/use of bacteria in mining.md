## Demining 
Demining or mine clearance is the process of removing land mines from an area. In military operations the object is to rapidly clear a path through a minefield and this is often done with devices such as mine plows and blast waves. By contrast the goal of humanitarian demining is to remove all of the landmines to a given depth and make the land safe for human use.
