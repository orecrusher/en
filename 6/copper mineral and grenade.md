THE GEOLOGY OF COPPER Copper occurs in three different mineral groups (see table 5-1). In sulfide mineral deposits the copper is linked with sulfur. In carbonate depos-its the copper occurs with carbon and oxygen. In silie mineral deposits the copper is linked with silicon and oxygen. The latter two groups are also termed oxide ores.

Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source local environmental regulations and other factors.. As in all mining operations the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).
