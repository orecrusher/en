## Gold and copper leaching from gold
 · Gold and copper extraction from gold-copper sulfides ore containing 0.77 ppm Au and 0.15% porphyry Cu (mainly present as chalcopyrite) has been calculated and presented in Fig. 3 Fig. 4 respectively. Fig. 3 shows that by adding 2 g/L glycine at similar cyanide concentration (450 ppm NaCN) gold extraction increased from 29.2% to 38.9%.

## Processes 
An ore is a rock containing enough valuable mineral to make it worth extracting. In the case of copper it is worth extracting when there is about 2 kg of copper per 1000 kg of ore (0.2%). Copper minerals are found in over one hundred varieties although only a few have been worked for copper on a large scale.

Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores including silver iron copper and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

## Why do we extract copper from low grade ores?
 · Bacteria feed on the low grade metal ores and form a solution of copper ions called a leachate. Slow process - it can take years to extract 50% of the metal from a low grade ore. Energy is needed in the elctrolysis step. Then the copper will be extracted from

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining Extraction
Extraction Ores are first mechanically crushed and ground so that nearly all copper mineral particles are freed from the gangue. Flotation by the injection of air and violent agitation is carried out with the pulverized ore held in suspension in water to which surface-active agents have been added.

## Extracting copper 
 · Copper can be extracted from copper-rich ores by heating the ores in a furnace (roasting and smelting).). Roasting and smelting both produce poisonous sulfur dioxide (SO 2). Thereafter the impure copper formed can be purified by electrolysis. Electrolysis is summarised in the diagram below and covered in the adjacent RSC video.
