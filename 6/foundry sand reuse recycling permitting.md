Foundries successfully recycle and reuse the sand many times in a foundry. When the sand can no longer be reused in the foundry it is removed from the foundry and is termed as waste foundry sand. Published literature has shown that WFS could be used in manufacturing Controlled Low-Strength Materials (CLSM) and concrete.

## Can You Reuse Casting Sand? 
 · Sand casting is a cheap fast and efficient fabriion method for less detailed projects with short production runs. While the ability to reuse sand does provide a benefit most fabriors will opt to recycle instead. Casting sand is cheap enough that repurchasing can often be as cost effective as rejuvenating used sand.

This reclaimed sand may be mixed with all of our RCS currently in use. About recycling. We have been recycling casting waste sand for around 40 years. Reusing the reclaimed sand as resin coated sand it has been working to cut waste emissions and to reduce resource consumption and thus making significant contribution to environmental conservation.

## Green Sand: An Introduction to Its Use in Foundries 
Green sand is a compound mixture used for casting of metals in foundry appliions as a mould. It is 'green' not by colour but takes the moniker due to the fact that it is not 'set' when the metal is poured into it rather it is still in the 'green' or uncured state.

## Foundry Sand 
Used foundry sand (UFS) (Fig. 4.1) is a discarded material coming from ferrous (iron and steel) and nonferrous (copper aluminium and brass) metal-casting industry to create molds and cores. About 1 ton of foundry sand for each ton of iron or steel casting produced is used ( Siddique and Noumowec 2008 ).

## FOUNDRY SAND WASTE 
FOUNDRY SAND WASTE. Foundries create metal castings for use in the automotive art construction agriculture and mining industries. In this process molten metal is poured into a mold usually made from sand or ceramics. As castings are created the sand has to be removed and replaced due to abrasion from the high heat and mechanical stress.

## Global trends and status in waste foundry sand management 
 · Waste foundry sand (WFS) is the by-product of the foundry industry which is produced about 0.6 tons per 1 ton of foundry industry production. While it cannot be recycled or reused it will be disposed of in landfills. Today with increasing attention to environmental issues the reuse and recycle of materials because of limited resources have been considered.

## Foundry Sands Recycling 
The spent foundry sand that is the sand that is removed is either recycled in a non-foundry appliion or landfilled. Estimates are that less than 15 percent of the 6-10 million tons of spent foundry sands generated annually is recycled. The Agency believes a greater percentage of spent foundry sand can be safely and economically recycled.

## Re
 · The cleaned foundry sand end-product can therefore be used for geo-engineering and green construction purposes thus providing foundries with a new revenue source while reducing the financial and environment cost of landfilling. The project sought first to establish the origins of the surplus sands from foundries such as steel and iron foundries.

 · The foundry produces nearly 200000 tons of usable sand annually as well as approximately 35000 tons of cupola slag which is being recycled. Environmental Manager Larry Bowers describes the success of his program in the following way: "We now reuse over 95% of our solid byproducts with an annual savings of more than $5 million."
