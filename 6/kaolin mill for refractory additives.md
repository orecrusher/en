## Recent advances in silica
 · Kaolin clay basic raw materials for the elaboration of silica-alumina refractory is resulting from hydrothermal alteration of alkali granite. This alteration caused the kaolinization of alkali-feldspar of the granitic rock and gives an aluminous friable material ( Fig. 1 ) rich in kaolin clay with an appreciable quantity of quartz flakes of muscovite and chloritized biotite.
