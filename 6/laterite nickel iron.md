- Iron is introduced into the laterite from outer sources (absolute iron accumulation). The difficulties of absolute iron accumulation on a larger scale were already discussed. Moreover it is inexplicable that an introduction of iron is only active in lateritization of acidic and not of mafic and ultramafic rocks.
