 · Quartz is the most important sand-forming mineral and occurs in very many sand types but usually not exclusively. In this sand type (which is aptly named quartz sand) quartz is almost the sole component of sand. Similar sandstones are called quartz arenites or orthoquartzites.. Fine-grained quartz sand from the St Peter formation (Ordovician sandstone) from Minnesota USA.

## Quartz Properties
Mechanical properties of fused quartz are much the same as those of other glasses. The material is extremely strong in compression with design compressive strength of better than 1.1 x 10 9 Pa (160000 psi). Surface flaws can drastically reduce the inherent strength of any glass so tensile properties are greatly influenced by these defects.

## Micro–macro properties of quartz sand: Experimental 
It was assumed that the sand grains are spherical particles and dry material (non-cohesive). In the first step of the calibration process the Sandglass test was performed to measure the macroscopic properties of quartz sand. Then the Sandglass was simulated by DEM for a varied range of coefficients of rolling and sliding friction.
