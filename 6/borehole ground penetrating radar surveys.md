## Ground Penetrating Radar (G.P.R.) 
How does Ground Penetrating Radar (G.P.R.) Work? Radar surveys work by launching pulses of energy into the soil or ground from the antenna. These pulses are reflected by any subsurface objects that may be present. The radar system is then able to measure the position and depth of any objects found and thus enables a []

## Identifiion of geo
 · Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is an effective means of detecting underground structures which can be applied to drilling engineering to detect geo-bodies in the borehole. Although the GPR image can reflect the type and distribution of the geo-bodies to some extent it is still a research hotspot to identify the geological body based on the detection results.
