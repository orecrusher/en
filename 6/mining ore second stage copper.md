## Copper Mining and Extraction: Oxide Ores
Copper is refined from ores in the ground either through underground or open-pit mines. Most of the copper ores mined today are oxide or sulfide ores. Extraction of sulfide ores is covered in more detail in Copper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide Ores (11–14) but is introduced here because an important by-product of this process is used for the extraction of oxide ores.

Low grade ores only contain small concentrations of copper and would not normally be considered economic to mine and process as would waste material from processing high grade copper ores. These two methods avoid traditional mining methods of digging moving and disposing of large amounts of rock - they make finite copper resources last longer and reduce the impact on the environment.
