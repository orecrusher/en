## Stump Grinding vs Removal: Which Method To Choose? 
 · Stump grinding is easier than stump removal. The stump grinding machine does most of the work by making the stump disappear by chopping it into smaller wood shaving pieces. It is also less expensive than stump removal which is why it is the preferred method for homeowners and professional landscapers alike.

A three-dimensional finite element model of rail grinding was established to explore the effects of grinding passes and grinding direction on the material removal behaviour of grinding rails during the grinding process. The results indie that as the number of grinding passes increases a decrease in the grinding force reduces both the amount of removed rail material and the surface roughness.

## Towards predicting removal rate and surface roughness 
A grinding model (based on the volumetric removal of lateral cracks accounting for neighboring lateral crack removal efficiency and the fraction of abrasive particles leading to fracture initiation) and a roughness model (based on the depth of lateral cracks or the interface gap between the workpiece and lap) are shown to quantitatively describe the material removal rate and roughness as a
