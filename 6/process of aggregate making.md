 · Making cheese is both an art and a science. Cheesemakers rely as much on measurements of pH levels and inoculations of specific molds as they do their own senses of sight touch and smell. There are six important steps in cheesemaking: acidifiion coagulation separating curds and whey salting shaping and ripening.

Cheese making. The key step in cheese production is the separation of the milk into solid curds and liquid whey. This separation is achieved by inducing the aggregation processes between casein micelles by acidifying the milk or adding rennet. The acidifiion neutralizes the carboxylate groups on the micelles and induces the aggregation.
