Marginally poor subgrade soils may be made acceptable by using additional base layers. These layers spread pavement loads over a larger subgrade area. This option is rather perilous; when designing pavements for poor subgrades the temptation may be to just design a thicker section with more base material because the thicker section will satisfy most design equations.

## Soil Suction Measurements in Highway Subgrades
Soil Suction Measurements in Highway Subgrades. The performance of rural highways in Saskatchewan Canada constructed of a thin pavement structure is largely controlled by the strength of subgrade soil. The subgrade of these highways consists of compacted unsaturated soil and its strength is a function of net normal stress and soil suction.
