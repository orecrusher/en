## Hydrometallurgical processing of magnesium minerals – A 
 · The processes of Table 1 can be adapted to more complied mineral feeds including serpentine (Ficara et al. 1998) although any silies or sulfates (e.g. due to sulfuric acid leaching) would be eliminated upstream so that the final magnesium metal release would be from either MgCl 2 for electrolytic process or from a MgO or CaO/MgO for a thermoreductive process.

## What is biomining? 
Biomining is mineral processing with microbes. Biomining is the process of using microorganisms (microbes) to extract metals of economic interest from rock ores or mine waste. Biomining techniques may also be used to clean up sites that have been polluted with metals. Valuable metals are commonly bound up in solid minerals. Some microbes can oxidize those metals allowing them

## How do we extract minerals? 
Placer mining is used to recover valuable minerals from sediments in present-day river channels beach sands or ancient stream deposits. More than half of the world's titanium comes from placer mining of beach dunes and sands. In placer operations the mined material is washed and sluiced to concentrate the heavier minerals.

## Extraction of Zinc 
The required mineral is now repelled by the water surface and gets attached to the air bubbles. As these air bubbles rise above the surface with mineral particles sticking to them these are the froth. This Froth is now collected separated and is taken for the next process of refining and extraction.
