## The ABC's of Gravel 
In considering the cost of crusher run vs. washed stone realize that 25% to 45% of the weight of crusher run gravel is composed of particles smaller than 2 mm. Although quarries price gravel on a per-ton basis its simpler to calculate gravel needs and compare costs based on cubic yards.
