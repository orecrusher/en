## CPE: Lesson 13. Principle of Size Reduction
For example coarse crushers have size reduction ratios of below 8:1 while fine grinders may present ratios as high as 100:1. However large reduction ratios such as those obtained when dividing relatively large solid lumps to ultra-fine powders are normally attained by several stages using diverse crushing and grinding machines.
