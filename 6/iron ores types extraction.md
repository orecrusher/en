 · Iron is mainly extracted from hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite ores. Natural or direct shipping iron ores contain between 50-70% iron and can be fed directly into the blast furnace. Fe 3 O 4 decomposes when heated to ferrous oxide (FeO) and ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3) via Fe 3 O 4 → FeO + Fe 2 O 3. A specialized type of coal called hard coal

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
