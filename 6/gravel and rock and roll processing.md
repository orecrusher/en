## Gravel And Rock Processing 
Gravel And Rock Processing. Gravel is a mixture of three sizes or types of material stone sand and fines.This will be discussed further in the next section.Without a good blend of these three sizes the gravel will perform poorly.Unfortunately poor performing gravel will often be blamed on the maintenance operator.But the operator cannot make good gravel out of bad.

## Diamond Mining Methods 
Once the diamond bearing ore and gravel is collected it is transported to a primary crusher. The primary crusher is responsible for reducing the size of the ore into smaller more manageable pieces or chucks measuring no larger than 150mm. A secondary crusher known as a roll-crusher may also be used to reduce the size of the ore even further.

 · Soft Rock and Shale Embankments. In embankments composed of rock fill with rocks that weather quickly there is a potential for the rocks to become soil. As a consequence these materials could fall into the spaces between the rocks — leading to significant settlement of the embankment and ultimately slope failure. It is for this reason that shale is not recommended; large pieces of shale
