Absolute pressure). The hot flue-gases rising out of the furnace are less dense creating a pressure drop within the heat exchanger. This "gap" is continually being filled by the higher pressure entering air/gas mixture. So in effect the gasses entering the furnace are helping to "push" the flue gasses out of the furnace. See Figure 2.

## Energy Tips – Process Heating
A furnace operates at 2400° F flue gas temperature. The optimum ratio is 10% excess air (2.1% O2 in flue gases) but tests show an actual ratio of 25% excess air (4.5% O 2 in flue gases). The chart shows an actual available heat of 22% compared to an ideal of 29%. Fuel Savings = 100 X (( 29 – 22 )

 · Your high efficiency furnace is powered by combusting natural gas. The burning of natural gas creates water and carbon monoxide as by-products. Waste water is drained into your sewer system while waste gasses like carbon monoxide are piped outside of your house.

## How Does a Furnace Vent Gas? Your Gas Furnace's 
How high-efficiency furnaces vent gas. In a high-efficiency furnace (90 AFUE or above) the combustion gases are in a liquid form. That's because there is a second heat exchanger that extracts more heat out of the combustion gases which cools them down into a liquid. In these systems a fan blows the combustion byproducts out of a flue pipe that extends out of the side of your home.

 · The furnaces are often designed on the basis of refractory radiation heating the charge with usually reasonable results but some situations cannot be explained by refractory radiation alone. Direct radiation from furnace gases generally delivers 62 % (+/- 2 %) of the heat to the charge and refractories transfer the remaining 38 % (+/- 2 %).

Steel mill gases are generated in the blast furnace the BOF melt shop and the coke plant. In the coke plant coke is produced by heating coal in the absence of air. Coke is harder than coal and porous facilitating the flow of hot air in the blast furnace and stabilizing the column it forms with the iron ore.
