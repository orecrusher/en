## Should You Put Gravel or Rocks at the Bottom of Plant Pots 
 · Give plants as much space to spread their roots out relative to what they can use or need. The more moisture retentive growing medium/potting mix available the less often a plant will need to be watered as long as the pot is not too big. Nearly all plants prefer a natural wet-dry cycle as that's what they experience in nature.
