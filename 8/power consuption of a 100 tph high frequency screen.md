## How Much Energy Does A Solar Panel Produce? 
 · For some panels their high power output rating is due to their larger physical size rather than their higher efficiency or technological superiority. For example if two solar panels both have 15 percent efficiency ratings but one has a power output rating of 250 watts and the other is rated at 300 watts it means that the 300-watt panel is about 20 percent physically larger than the 250

When calculating power consumption of PC components most consumers fail to factor in case fan power usage. That is a common mistake - While case fans typically don't contribute much to the power requirements of PC components it does matter in certain scenarios: e.g. building a NAS or HTPC (where every watt counts) or in high end rigs with five fans or more.

## How much power does a computer use? And how much CO2 
The power consumption of a computer varies depending on whether it is a desktop or a laptop:. A desktop uses an average of 200 W/hour when it is being used (loudspeakers and printer included). A computer that is on for eight hours a day uses almost 600 kWh and emits 175 kg of CO 2 per year.; A laptop uses between 50 and 100 W/hour when it is being used depending on the model.

Radiofrequency (RF) radiation which includes radio waves and microwaves is at the low-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is a type of non-ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing radiation does not have enough energy to remove electrons from an atom. Visible light is another type of non-ionizing radiation.

Power consumption is about linear with frequency. The processor contains millions of complementary FETs as shown. When the input goes low the small capacitance gets charged and it will hold a small amount of energy. A same amount is lost during the charging. When the input goes high again the charge will be drained to ground and be lost.
