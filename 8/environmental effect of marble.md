## Marble Rock: Geology Properties Uses 
 · Marble is a metamorphic rock formed when limestone is subjected to high pressure or heat. In its pure form marble is a white stone with a crystalline and sugary appearance consisting of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Usually marble contains other minerals including quartz graphite pyrite and iron oxides.These minerals can give marble a pink brown gray green or variegated coloration.

## How does acid precipitation affect marble and limestone 
When sulfurous sulfuric and nitric acids in polluted air and rain react with the calcite in marble and limestone the calcite dissolves. In exposed areas of buildings and statues we see roughened surfaces removal of material and loss of carved details. Stone surface material may be lost all over or only in spots that are more reactive.
