The iron ore must be pelletized to 8-18 mm pellets to feed the direct reduction unit. This process is called pelletization. Pellet manufacturing combines chemical thermal and mechanical processes to give it the required homogeneous composition. The granulation is done in a humid environment in saucers to ensure the cohesion of the material.

All effective methods of direct reduction actually use the same process: rich iron ore (fine concentrate or pellets) is reduced by a special gas mixture up to the iron content of 85-90%. This explains why the production of direct-reduced iron is mainly concentrated in countries with large reserves of oil (oilwell gas) natural gas and iron ore as well as limited scrap resources.
