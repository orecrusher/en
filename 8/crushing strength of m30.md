## Difference Between M25 and M30 Concrete 
Theoretically you can know if it is M25 or M30 if you know the composition of Cement: Sand: Add to the mixture. If you want to know about it after molding concrete into structural elements the Rebound Hammer test can be used. It is a non-destructive test. Using a conversion graph we can calculate the compressive strength of the structural

## Compressive Or Crushing Strength 
Compressive Or Crushing Strength. Compression across the grain is very closely related to hardness and transverse shear. There are two ways in which wood is subjected to stress of this kind namely (1) with the load acting over the entire area of the specimen and (2) with a load concentrated over a portion of the area. (See Fig. 2.)

## Compressive Strength of Concrete 
 · Concrete compressive strength for general construction varies from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) and higher in commercial and industrial structures. Compressive strength of concrete depends on many factors such as water-cement ratio cement strength quality of concrete material quality control during the production of concrete etc.

In practical terms the number itself isn't all that meaningful but it becomes useful to use in comparison with other woods. For instance Ipe is known to have excellent strength properties among imported species and has a crushing strength of 13510 lb f /in 2 (93.1 MPa). In comparison White Oak is a well-known wood used in cabinetry and furniture and has a crushing strength of 7440 lb
