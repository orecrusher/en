## Extraction of Metals: Ores and Minerals 
The process of extracting metal ores buried deep underground is called Mining. The metal ores are found in the earth's crust in varying abundance. The extraction of metals from ores is what allows us to use the minerals in the ground! The ores are very different from the finished metals that we see in buildings and bridges.

The important feature of the EAF steelmaking process is that the raw materials are recycled steel scrap and fluxes without the step of iron ore extraction. This results in overall cost of per tonne of annual installed capacity in the range of $127–182/t ($140–200/ton) for an EAF-based operation compared to approximately $1110/t ($1000/ton) for a BF-BOF-based operation ( Jones 1988 ).

Titanium is made by a batch process. In the production of iron for example there is a continuous flow through the Blast Furnace. Iron ore and coke and limestone are added to the top and iron and slag removed from the bottom. This is a very efficient way of making something. With titanium however you make it one batch at a time.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? 
 · Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.
