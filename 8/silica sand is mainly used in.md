## What Is the Difference Between Washed Sand Silica Sand 
Silica sand isn't necessarily washed sand. Silicon dioxide is a chemical compound that is also known as silica. Silica sand is a type of sand that mostly consists of tiny granules of quartz. Quartz itself comes in many varieties according to its color and microstructure. Silica sand also consists of other fine particles of rock and mineral.

## Different Types of Sand and What They Should be Used for 
On a comparative level artificial sand is a very close match to building sand mostly because building sand tends to be more widely used than any of the other types. In terms of how artificial sand is made generally it is produced through crushing up basalt rock or granite rock and due to this is normally greyish in colour.

Silica Sand Is Mainly Used In. To make calcium silie bricks silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sandlime ratio of 10 or 20.The mix is then compressed into moulds and autoclaved at about 170c 340f for several hours.Some gel similar to the calcium silie hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement is formed and this bonds the sand particles together.

Silica sand is mainly used because of its thermal conductivity. It can absorb and transmit heat while allowing the gases generated during the thermal degradation of binders to pass through the grains. As a molding material the sand is compacted and shaped according to the mold pattern that is going to be produced as well as to create cavities.
