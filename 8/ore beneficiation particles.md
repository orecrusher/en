## Background 
Iron Ore Beneficiation. Beneficiation is concerned with recovering and concentrating the valuable ore from the run-of-mine feed with different technologies applied to specific particle size ranges. Fine particles are usually well liberated and thus have the potential to produce high grade concentrate.

Beneficiation can begin within the mine itself. Most mines will have a crusher within the mine itself where separation of ore and gangue minerals occurs and as a side effect becomes easier to transport. After the crusher the ore will go through a grinder or a mill to get the ore into fine particles.

Most of such resources exist as finer particles while lean-grade ores require fine grinding for liberation of associated gangue minerals. Hematite is the most abundant iron ore mineral present in available resources while the major impurities include silica alumina calcite clay matter and phosphorus.

 · Barsua iron ore mines a captive iron ore mines of Rourkela Steel Plant has adopted Remco Jigs for the beneficiation of low-grade iron ore fines at a size range of − 8 + 2 mm. Similarly a Batac jig has been installed to reduce alumina content from the Noamundi iron ore fines of Tata Steel and the Apic jig used in iron ore mines of South Africa has confirmed the separation of fine ferrous ores.

 · Effects of Particle size: The effect of the particle size on the recovery of iron ore is also shown in Tables 45 and 6 and Figures 4 5 and 6. The highest recovery was achieved at 600µm. Lower separation efficiency in finer particles is believed to be caused by the negligible mass associated with this size particles.

## Impact that Mineral Particles Have on Ore Beneficiation
If the crushed particles are too coarse and the dissociation is not enough the quality and recovery rate of ore beneficiation will be influenced. However if minerals stones are over crushed more tiny particles that are difficult to separate will turn up which leads to the mineral loss

## Graphite 
Graphite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ f ˌ aɪ t /) archaically referred to as plumbago is a crystalline form of the element carbon with its atoms arranged in a hexagonal structure.It occurs naturally in this form and is the most stable form of carbon under standard conditions.Under high pressures and temperatures it converts to diamond.Graphite is used in pencils and lubricants.
