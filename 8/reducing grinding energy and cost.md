 · The benefit is not only substantially decreased CO2 emissions but also increased energy efficiency of grinding processes saving over $15 million a year in energy costs [23]. The reduction in carbon emissions should be given credit in the assessment instead of rating mining as a 0 which designers do if mining is involved.

## Energy and Cost Comparisons of HPGR
A reduction in energy consumption of 34% was determined to be attainable through implementation of the HPGR-stirred mill circuit when targeting a final P80 grind size of 75 micron. Project economics were also in favor of the proposed circuit and would further improve in regions where energy supply is more expensive than the relatively low energy unit costs used as a basis for this evaluation.
