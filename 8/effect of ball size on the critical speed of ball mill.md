As you get closer to the tip the diameter on the ball gets smaller and smaller finally going to zero. As a result the cutter must perform over a wide range of surface speeds and chip loads at different depths in the cut.

In addition to having an impact on speed and trajectory the size and mass of balls also contribute to how external forces affect them. When two balls of the same diameter are made of materials of different density and mass the ball with the greater mass-density will travel farther if projected with the same amount of force or at the same initial speed.
