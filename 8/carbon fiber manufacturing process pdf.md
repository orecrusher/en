## The Equipment and Process of Resin Infusion 
Carbon Fiber (Graphite) and Kevlar® reinforcements can also be used in vacuum infusion though they tend to infuse more slowly. To counteract this the addition of flow media was found to greatly increase infusion rates and create successful parts using both #1110 Vinyl Ester and #2000 Epoxy resins.

 · Depending upon the manufacturing process and the precursor material carbon fiber can be quite soft and can be made into or more often integreted into protective clothing for firefighting. Nickel coated fiber is an example. Because carbon fiber is also chemically very inert it can be used where there is fire combined with corrosive agents.

## Chapter 2 Precursors and Manufacturing of Carbon Fibers 
In this chapter we will present the precursors and manufacturing of carbon fibers. Among the precursors used for the production of carbon fibers polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based and pitch-based precursors are the most important. A significant amount of work has been done on relating the fiber structure to the properties and translating that relationship into production for either reducing cost
