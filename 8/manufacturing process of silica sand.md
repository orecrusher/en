## silica sand manufacturing process 
Making of fused silica. The electric fusion is the most commonly used melting process for manufacturing quartz glass. Two methods of electric fusion can be used Continuous fusion In the continuous method quartz sand is poured into the top of a vertical melter that consists of a refractory metal crucible surrounded by electric heating elements.

## Silica Sand 
To make calcium silie bricks silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand–lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170°C (340°F) for several hours. Some gel similar to the calcium silie hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement is formed and this bonds the sand particles together.
