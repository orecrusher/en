Gold recognizable by its yellowish cast is one of the oldest metals used by humans. As far back as the Neolithic period humans have collected gold from stream beds and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C. when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry religious artifacts and utensils such as goblets.
