## 3 ways to control motors for precision movement in 
 · Motors serve as integral components of motion control systems for industrial conveyors. Typically conveyor appliions operate at either a constant or variable speed requiring only velocity control from a main drive motor. Positioning conveyors such as those used for automated checkweighers require more precision control.
