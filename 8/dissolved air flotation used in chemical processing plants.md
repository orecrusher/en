 · Most process plants use substantial amounts of water. The water comes from a range of sources such as rivers lakes wells and oceans and contains dissolved and suspended solids. To reduce consumption most plants reuse water; this in turn causes it to be highly concentrated in silie iron and calcium carbonate that prompt limescale build-up and rust.

Dissolved air is the most common type of flotation gas used in potable water treatment. The dissolved air flotation (DAF) process mixes a clarified stream from the outlet of the unit with air at 3–9 bar to produce a supersaturated (compared with saturation at atmospheric pressure) solution of air in water.

## Understand Industrial Wastewater 
 · Flocculation is a process of slow mixing with retention times of 12–40 min. Some designs for large plants have used lower retention times say 9–10 minutes but typically times of 11 12 or 15 min. are recommended. It is a process that requires less energy for agitation than coagulation. Dissolved air flotation.

## Sludge treatment − dissolved air flotation 
 · How DAF works. Dissolved air flotation (DAF) provides thickening of sludges (i.e. thickens the sludge) by encouraging the solids to float to the surface rather than allowing them to sink as in gravity thickening.. DAF is applied to increase the sludge solids concentration when these solids are neutrally buoyant (i.e. neither sink nor float) and so cannot be readily removed by settling.
