## Buoyancy for Kids: Will it Sink or Float? 
We have a few theories. Mandarins with dense segments will sink. Mandarins that have air in the segments will float. Sometimes water will get between the segments adding more weight making the mandarin sink. When the pith or white part of the mandarin isn't fully removed it can act as a barrier to water entering between the segments.

## Floating wind turbine 
A floating wind turbine is an offshore wind turbine mounted on a floating structure that allows the turbine to generate electricity in water depths where fixed-foundation turbines are not feasible. Floating wind farms have the potential to significantly increase the sea area available for offshore wind farms especially in countries with limited shallow waters such as Japan.

## Surface tension 
Surface tension is the tendency of liquid surfaces at rest to shrink into the minimum surface area possible. Surface tension is what allows objects with a higher density than water such as razor blades and insects (e.g. water striders) to float on a water surface without becoming even partly submerged.. At liquid–air interfaces surface tension results from the greater attraction of liquid
