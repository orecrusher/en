Burnett pointed out that the ore could be treated by simple amalgamation and that the building of a five-stamp mill was certainly justified by the extent and amount of gold-bearing ore exposed. The mill could also perform custom work for leasers on outlying claims with provision being made to add another five stamps as the full extent of ore reserves was established.

At the bottom massive concrete foundations were poured to build a large stamp mill where the ores were crushed and the gold and other valuable metals separated. By 1906 gold bars were being shipped to the Denver Mint. The future looked bright and a new "Mill Level" tunnel was started just above the mill directly into the base of the mountain.

Primitive crushing was done by hand pounding the ore with a hard stone then by using metallic hammers. The mortar and pestle was mechanized using a lever and when the size of operations increased in the middle ages the stamp mill was introduced. The grindstone played an important role in grinding of ores.

 · Ball Mill Crushing by tube-mills were first introduced into the crushing departments of cyanide plants when it was found that for crushing finer than 30-mesh other types of crushing machinery were not efficient. In order to crush with one pass these mills were made 18 to 22 ft. (5.5 to 6.7 m.) in length. Pebbles were used as a grinding medium and the mills were lined with either silex

 · The ore is introduced continuously in the mortar which falls on the block. The crushing operation is carried out in aqueous pulp. Its reduction ratio is quite high upto 150 ( 8 am piece can be reduced to 0.05 am) and thus in the past stamp mills have done a great service in crushing of gold ores for amalgamation.
