## Magnet Motor Free Energy Generator: Do they Really Work?
The magnetic energy that is used to run a motor over time does not require an outside energy source to generate electricity like the sun or water. It is running purely on the magnet arrangement. However over time the magnets can lose their magnetism so they will have to be replaced at some point to continue to generate electricity.

Low voltage (LV) variable frequency drives (VFDs) have been applied to appliions up to 2500 horsepower (HP). Medium voltage (MV) VFDs have been applied to appliions as low as 150 HP. Traditional power system design practice suggests that motor crossover from low voltage to medium voltage is in the HP range.
