## V
Before a new set of V-belts are installed check the condition of the sheaves. Dirty or rusty sheaves impair the drive's efficiency and abrade the belts which result in premature failure. Worn sheaves shorten belt life as much as 50%. If the grooves are worn to where the belt bottoms slippage may result and burn the belts.

## Mill belt drive conversion 
To change speed takes about 1 minute. To change a belt it is necessary to remove the top plate but hopefully this will be a rare occurrance. The mill is certainly much quieter with the belt drive and the highest speed is useful for small mills (less than 3 mm) whilst the slow speed is good for flycutting.

 · Anybody know how to adjust the Belt on a southbend 9a lathe? My belt seems to wander off the pulley. This is the under drive model where the lathe sits on a steel bench configuration and the motor is underneath the head stock with a metal door for access. I am going to replace the stock motor with a 3 phase one and wire up a vfd to it.

 · Center the treadmill belt. Adjust the belt so that it is centered in the machine. Belts can stretch and begin to lean to one side after frequent use. You can try repositioning the belt from the outside of the treadmill by pulling gently away from the slanted side. If the problem is severe a technician should look at the issue.

## How to measure your machine belt? 
When you measure a belt laid out on the floor you are measuring the belt's neutral layer. This measurement will be too short by an amount approximately equal to the belt's thickness x pi (3.14). If you can measure the inside circumference by putting the belt in a circle and putting the tape measure inside the circle your measurement will be closer.

## Lathes
Endless flat belts are renowned for smooth vibration-free running especially around small-diameter pulleys yet for efficient power transmission the pulleys do need to be set some distance apart. Flat belts with a joiner - often called alligator clips - suffer from a clacking noise as they run and at high speed can induce vibrations marks into the turned surface.

The belt should have a consistent ridged feel from one side of the belt to the other (a belt can be worn out without any sensory signs of a problem). If you feel deep grooves in the deck or uneven wear on the underside of the belt part replacement is necessary. Visually look at the underside of the belt. It should have a consistent look.
