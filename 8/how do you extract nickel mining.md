## Nickel Statistics and Information 
Nickel (Ni) is a transition element that exhibits a mixture of ferrous and nonferrous metal properties. It is both siderophile (i.e. associates with iron) and chalcophile (i.e. associates with sulfur). The bulk of the nickel mined comes from two types of ore deposits:

## Nickel processing 
 · Nickel requires higher smelting temperatures (in the range of 1350 °C [2460 °F]) in order to produce an artificial nickel-iron sulfide known as matte which contains 25 to 45 percent nickel. In the next step iron in the matte is converted to an oxide which combines with a silica flux to form a slag.

## Nickel: smelting producing
Nickel: smelting; Extraction and purifiion; Nickel is recovered through extractive metallurgy: it is extracted from its ores by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield a metal of greater than 75% purity. In many stainless steel appliions 75% pure nickel can be used without further purifiion depending on the composition of the impurities.

## How is rhodium extracted? 
In Sudbury as they continue to mine for nickel and platinum when rhodium is found they use this process or one very similar to get just the bare rhodium to use/sell. This is why here in Canada a very small amount of rhodium is extracted. Annually in the world only 20-30 tons of rhodium are produced/extracted.
