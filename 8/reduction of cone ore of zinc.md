## Zinc smelting 
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals e.g. iron because in contrast zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost unless specific

## Reduction of Metals (Extraction from Ore) 
Reduction of metal halides with metals. In many cases carbon cannot be used to reduce the metal oxide to the metal as the metal reacts with carbon to form the carbide instead. It is possible to avoid this problem by first converting the ore to the chloride and then reducing the chloride with a more reactive metal such as magnesium or sodium.

2ZnS + 3O2 → 2ZnO + 2SO2. Reduction: Zinc oxide is mixed with powdered coke and heated to 1673K in a fire clay in which ZnO is reduced to zinc metal. The carbon from coke will act as a reducing agent in this reaction. The reaction involved in the final step of extraction of zinc is: ZnO + C → Zn + CO.
