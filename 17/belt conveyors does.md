## ConvEx Paper 
In essence the dynamics of a belt conveyor does not change with the belt speed. However with increasing belt speed the rate of changes increases which will result in a decreasing running stability of the belt. This paper is not intended to fully discuss belt conveyor dynamics. It is referred to [7] where this topic is extensively discussed.
