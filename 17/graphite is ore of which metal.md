Flake graphite is a crystalline form of natural graphite that occurs in different sized flakes in the ground. Flakes can range from small (-150 mesh) to medium (-100 mesh) large (+100 +80 mesh) and extra-large or jumbo (+50 mesh). Flake graphite ore is processed into a concentrate through crushing grinding flotation and drying.

## Why does graphite conduct electricity
While nearly all metals and graphite can conduct electricity some have a better atomical structure for doing so. Gold or silver for example is structured in a way so that many of its free electrons can roam quickly making it a very good conductor of electricity. Since gold is so expensive it is not often that it is used in this manner.
