## Why calcium and constipation go together and how to 
Calcium carbonate. Rolaids and Tums contain calcium carbonate with 200 to 400 mg. in each tablet. Many inexpensive calcium supplements also contain calcium carbonate. The body doesn't absorb calcium carbonate very well. This poor absorption is one of the main reasons that calcium carbonate causes constipation problems.
