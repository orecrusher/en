## Hydrothermal Treatment of Low Rank Coal for Making High 
Currently the low rank coal water slurry (CWS) has a relatively low heat value compared with those made by high rank coal so it is lack of commercial attraction [7 8]. Even after traditional drying low rank coal is easy to reabsorb water in the slurry to lower

Low rank coal comprises sub-bituminous coal lignite and brown coal all of which contain substantial amounts of water (20% to 70% Total Moisture ("TM%") by weight). Due to its high moisture content low rank coal diminishes power plant efficiency and produces more emissions per unit of energy produced.

## COAL HANDLING
 · Coal (IPA: /ˈkəʊl/) is a fossil fuel formed in swamp ecosystems where plant remains were saved by water and mud from oxidization and biodegradation। Coal is a readily combustible black or brownish-black rock. It is a sedimentary rock but the harder forms such as anthracite coal can be regarded as metamorphic rocks because of later exposure to elevated temperature and pressure.
