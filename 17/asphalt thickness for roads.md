Increasing the thickness of gravel base (CBC) or sub-base (SGSB) components may sufficiently increase structural strength to offset reduced asphalt pavement thickness provided the base of the asphalt layer is less than 60 µ strain. Asphalt binder grades used by the Ministry depend on the loion climatic and traffic loading.

The minor arterial roads had an average asphalt layer thickness range of 91 - 99 mm ±22 mm against the designed thickness of 102 mm. Average values of relative dielectric constant of the asphalt layers were estimated in the newly constructed roads and its variation along the roads were used to loe potential low density section of the asphalt layers.
