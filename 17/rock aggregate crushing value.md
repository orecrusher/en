## Crushed Limestone Rock 
Crushed limestone is an angular rock typically produced by mining and crushing suitable rock deposits into desired sizes. It is one of the most accessible natural resources and a major basic raw material used by construction agriculture and other industries. It differs from gravel in that the latter has round edges and is formed through natural weatherization and erosion.

 · Crushed rock is useful in reducing step and touch potentials. Resistivity value of crushed rock depends on many factors such as type of locally available material size of stone washed vs un-washed stone etc. Washed rocks have less dust and has more resistivity compared to un-washed ones. Removing dust also aids in faster drying time after a rain.
