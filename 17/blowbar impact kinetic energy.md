 · This kinetic energy is generated by the combination of the mass of the impactor (370 kg; 816 lbs) and its velocity when it impacts (~10.2 km/s). Targeting and hitting the comet in a lit area is one of the mission's greatest challenges since the impactor will be traveling at 10 km per second and it must hit an area less than 6 km (3.7 miles) in diameter from about 864000 km (536865 miles) away.

 · Because kinetic energy is proportional to the velocity squared increases in velocity will have an exponentially greater effect on translational kinetic energy. Doubling the mass of an object will only double its kinetic energy but doubling the velocity of the object will quadruple its velocity.

## Factors That Affect Kinetic Energy by Isabella V
 · An objects kinetic energy depends on its speed. The faster an object moves the more kinetic energy it has. Kinetic Energy is energy due to motion. All moving objects have kinetic energy. A moving object's kinetic energy also depends on its mass. If two objects are moving at the same speed the object with more mass has more kinetic energy .

## What is non kinetic energy? 
What is non kinetic energy? non-kinetic energy (NKE) weapons by which is meant those weapons that seek to achieve their purpose other than through the threat or appliion of force to the human body. Less-lethal weapons have been developed to provide law enforcement corrections and military personnel with an alternative to lethal force.

## Kinetic energy 
Kinetic energy ( E or Ek or KE) is proportional to mass ( m) and proportional to the square of the velocity ( v) of an object. The constant of proportionality turns out to be ½ in this case: K E = 1 2 m v 2. The units of KE are Joules ( J ) 1 J = 1 Kg·m·s-2. Kinetic energy is not a vector.
