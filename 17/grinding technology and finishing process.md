## Superfinishing Technology 
Superfinishing is a chip removing machining process. But not one that is comparable to any other. In contrast to the classic lathe turning and grinding methods there is full surface contact between the tool and the workpiece. This is precisely the feature that produces the unique characteristics of a perfectly machined surface.

## What is Gear lapping and Gear Grinding Process? Amtech 
A gear may be finished in several different ways such as gear lapping or grinding. What is gear lapping? Gear lapping is the process of imparting a very fine finish and high degree of accuracy to gear teeth by using a lapping tool and applying a fine-grained abrasive between a work material and a closely fitting surface called a lapping plate.

The backgrinding process involves using a diamond-resin bonded grinding wheel to remove the silicon material from the back of a silicon wafer. Using a grinding wheel is highly effective and faster and less expensive than chemical-mechanical processes and is used to remove the bulk of substrate material prior to final finish grind polish or chemical etch.

 · On the other hand finish pass can improve finish accuracy and tolerance as very low feed and depth of cut are employed. Usage of old cutter: An old cutter may have less sharp edges (i.e. higher edge radius and nose radius) as it has already worn out during machining. Edge and nose sharpness limit the achievable surface finish in the process.
