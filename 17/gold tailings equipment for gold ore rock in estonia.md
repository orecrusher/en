The amount of tailings generated is dependent on the ore grade (proportion of valuable minerals in the ore). For example if the cut-off grade in the ore is 1 % Copper 99 percent of the total ore would be deposited as tailings. Iron ores generally have higher grades than sulfide or gold ores often going over 50 per cent or more.

## Who benefits from Atlantic Gold's Nova Scotia operations?
 · Atlantic Gold plans to be using public roads and bridges to transport millions of tonnes of rock ore from one open pit mining site to another in eastern Nova Scotia. Atlantic Gold plans to truck the crushed ore from the Beaver Dam mine 31 kilometres over sensitive wetlands for processing at Touquoy as the Examiner reported here and here.

## Safety First: Guidelines for Responsible Mine Tailings 
 · Over the past 40 years ore grades have declined on average by half for many minerals effectively doubling the volume of mine waste tailings generated for each unit of mineral produced. Current trends suggest an additional 2- to 10-fold increase in the extraction and uses of most minerals by 2060. These trends are not sustainable.

Use ore sorting equipment to concentrate ores and cut process costs There are many ways of improving recovery processes for a wide variety of ores using sorting equipment. At STEINERT we always take the same approach: sorting waste rock and ore with low concentrations out from the process at an early stage to save energy and resources and to unlock more enriched ore more effectively.
