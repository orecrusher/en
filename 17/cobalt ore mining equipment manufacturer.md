Cobalt is a ferromagnetic metal with a specific gravity of 8.9. The Curie temperature is 1115 °C (2039 °F) and the magnetic moment is 1.6–1.7 Bohr magnetons per atom. Cobalt has a relative permeability two-thirds that of iron. Metallic cobalt occurs as two crystallographic structures: hcp and fcc.The ideal transition temperature between the hcp and fcc structures is 450 °C (842 °F
