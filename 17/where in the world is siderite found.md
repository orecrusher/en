The colour ranges from yellow to dark brown and sometimes black which is caused by presence of manganese (sometimes called manganosiderite). Transparent crystals are cut into attractive faceted gems for collectors. Massive material is cut as cabochons.

## Siderite 
Siderite is some shade of brown or brownish yellow. It is more dense (3.96) than other common carbonates because of iron content. It occurs as an earthy mass or as concretionary nodules (clay ironstone) in iron-rich sedimentary rocks. Crystals form in hydrothermal veins and it may be found in banded iron formations from the Precambrian.
