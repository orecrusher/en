Nickeltetracarbonyl bildet sich beim Kontakt von fein verteiltem Nickelpulver mit Kohlenmonoxid ab 60 °C. Nach seinem Entdecker nennt man diese Synthese auch Mond-Verfahren das so gewonnene Nickel auch "Mond-Nickel": Die Reaktion ist reversibel. Ab 180 °C zerfällt die Verbindung in die Ausgangssubstanzen.

 · The nickel carbonyl gas process is used as a way of refining impure nickel. Nickel reacts with carbon monoxide to form nickel carbonyl gas (Ni (CO)4) which can be decomposed back to nickel metal at moderate temperatures with the recovery of carbon monoxide. Using thermal shock decomposition fine or extra fine nickel powders can be made.

Nickel Carbonyl The extremely toxic gas nickel carbonyl can be detected at 0.01 ppb by measuring its chemiluminescent reaction with ozone in the presence of carbon monoxide. The reaction produces excited nickel(II) oxide by a chain process which generates many photons from each pollutant molecule to permit high sensitivity (315).
