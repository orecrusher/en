Cement mill. History Early hydraulic cements such as those of James Parker James Frost and Joseph Aspdin were relatively soft and readily ground by the primitive technology of the day using flat millstonThe emergence of Portland cement in the 1840s made grinding considerably more difficult because the clinker produced by the kiln is often as hard as the millstone material.

## Cement Grinding Aids History 
A grinding aid is a specialty chemical agent used to make it easier to grind and mix cement. Specifically grinding aids prevent cement particles from reagglomeration or readhering during and after the grinding process. Grinding aids make it possible to streamline the cementmaking process by increasing process efficiency and material fluidity.
