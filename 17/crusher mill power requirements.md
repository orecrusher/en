Crushers are commonly classified by the degree to which they fragment not starting material with wares crushers not reducing it by much intermediate cruiser fragmenting it much more significantly and grinders reducing it to a fine power. Impact crushers: they involve the use of impact rather than pressure to crush materials.

Comminution is the reduction of solid materials from one average particle size to a smaller average particle size by crushing grinding cutting vibrating or other processes. In geology it occurs naturally during faulting in the upper part of the Earth's crust.
