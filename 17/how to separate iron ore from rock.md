## Smelting and Roasting Ores to recover gold silver and 
The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.

Iron is extracted from the ore containing the maximum amount of iron. This is found near the surface of the Earth. Iron ore is converted to iron by various processes. The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to extract pig iron. Pig iron comprises of about 92-94% iron and about 3-5% of carbon along with other impurities.

 · The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process. The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace. These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.

 · The next step once the ore is excavated is to separate the waste rock and ore using primary crushers loed at the open pit mine site. At this point larger rocks are broken down to a size better suited for the conveyor belt to transport. From there the ore is transported to a separate facility for smelting which is:
