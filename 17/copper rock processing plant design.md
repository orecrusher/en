 · Processing. The original design for the processing plant involved ore from the mine being conveyed to a 150t surge bin before grinding in a fully autogenous mill. This mill was converted during 2005 to semi-autogenous allowing the plant to handle harder ore as well as increasing the plant throughput to around 1Mt/y.
