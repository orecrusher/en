## How is Aluminium mined and extracted? – restaurantnorman
 · How is Aluminium mined and extracted? Extraction of aluminium metal takes place in three main stages¿mining of bauxite ore refining the ore to recover alumina and smelting alumina to produce aluminium. Bauxite is mined by surface methods (open-cut mining) in which the topsoil and overburden are removed by bulldozers and scrapers.

## How Is Iron Extracted From the Earth? 
 · Iron ores in the form of hematite (ferrous oxide) and magnetite are removed from the earth through mining. The use of heavy mining equipment is necessary to dig out large pits in an area with a large deposit of iron ore; however because iron does not occur naturally it is necessary to use a blast furnace to separate or refine iron from the other substances in the iron ore.
