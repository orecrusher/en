## Coal mining 
When coal seams are near the surface it may be economical to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast open pit mountaintop removal or strip) mining methods. Opencast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited. This equipment can include the following: Draglines which

Best practices and recommendations to achieve this are outlined in this document for mine operations to consider.
