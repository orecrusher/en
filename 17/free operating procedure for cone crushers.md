## Improved flow
 · A model for cone crushers was presented by Evertsson (2000). That model comprises a flow model and a size reduction model. The Evertsson flow model is based on mass balance and it has a single model parameter. A particle is released at the top of the mantle. Three modes of motion can occur: sliding free-fall and squeezing.

 · CONE CRUSHER. Cone crushers are similar to gyratory crushers in that they have a mantle that rotates within a bowl but the chamber is not as steep. They are compression crushers that generally provide reduction ratios of 6-to-1 to 4-to-1. Cone crushers are used in secondary tertiary and quaternary stages.

Cone crushers are commonly used for secondary crushing (although impact crushers are sometimes used) which typically reduces material to about 2.5 to 10 centimeters (1 to 4 inches). The material (throughs) from the second level of the screen bypasses the secondary crusher because it is sufficiently small for the last crushing step.
