## Traction motors in diesel locomotives 
 · When a locomotive pulls a load weight tends to transfer from the front axle to the rear axle of each truck. At maximum tractive effort the weight on the lead axle may be reduced by about 20%. Since the tractive effort is proportional to the weight on drivers the tractive effort will be determined by the lightest axle in a system where the motors are fed from a common source.
