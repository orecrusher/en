Mining Safety is our biggest motivation behind our RFD designs allowing engineers to initiate a blast for up to 3-5 miles clear of fly rock and debris. Significantly reduce your costs by eliminating excess lead-in lines between the explosives and the initiator applicable for surface blasting and underground mining appliions via a leaky feeder system.
