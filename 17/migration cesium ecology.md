## The ecology behavior and conservation of migratory birds
 · NOROCK scientists and partners are studying the behavior and ecology of birds during flight and stopover using a variety of remote sensing techniques. For example recent research concerns how migrating birds respond when they encounter barriers to movement such as mountains or oceans. We are finding that prior to crossing the Gulf of Mexico a
