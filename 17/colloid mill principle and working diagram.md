 · Working principle of Colloid Mills. A colloid mill is a machine use to disintegrate solid particles or droplet size of a suspended or emulsion liquid. The machine consist of an inlet (which is subject to tremendous shearing action which effect uniform size time dispersion) and an outlet. Colloid milling operates on the principle of rotor-stator.
