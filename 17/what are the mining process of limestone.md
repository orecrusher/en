## Dimension Stone Mining 
Limestone and sandstone are used as dimension stone in Arkansas. Historically much nepheline syenite was used as hand-worked building stone in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in the Little Rock (Pulaski County) area but beginning in the middle 1940s those labor-intensive activities gave way to the use of crushed stone for syenite.

 · Sintering: A Step Between Mining Iron Ore and Steelmaking. The USGS defines iron ore as a mineral substance which when heated in the presence of a reductant will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3). It's a major ingredient in steel.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

Limestone rock is a sedimentary rock which forms in the process of sedimentation at the bottom of lakes and oceans or in caves. It is mainly composed of mineral calcite and aragonite both of which are crystal forms of calcium carbonate. A limestone with 95 percent or more of calcium carbonate by weight is known as a high-calcium limestone.
