## Kinematics 
Kinematics is a subfield of physics developed in classical mechanics that describes the motion of points bodies (objects) and systems of bodies (groups of objects) without considering the forces that cause them to move. Kinematics as a field of study is often referred to as the "geometry of motion" and is occasionally seen as a branch of mathematics.

## Continuous Generation Grinding 
 · In the past kinematic deviations caused by surface structure or undulations have often led to the pairing of two gears with different hard finishing methods such as honing and grinding. In order to change the repetitive microstructure honing was added in the past as a secondary manufacturing process in some noise-sensitive appliions.
