## Limestone Facts 
Limestone is a sedimentary rock that contains at least 50% calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Because sedimentary rocks are made of various types of sediments the other 50% of a limestone rock could be virtually any other mineral. Limestone originates in wet areas which mean it could also be composed of shells and waste matter from organisms.

## How does weathering affect limestone? 
 · Weathering is the breakdown of rock by physical chemical or biological processes. Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater which contains a weak carbonic acid reacts with limestone. This causes the limestone to dissolve. Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
