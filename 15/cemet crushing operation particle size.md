 · grinding process In most industries size reduction could be divided into main egories: crushing and grinding. Grinding also called fine milling or pulverising is the process of reducing materials to fine powder or very fine particle size. Grinding process is different from crushing which reduce the big massive materials to a rock pebble or grain size.

## Multiple Choice Questions on Mechanical Operations
1. Size enlargement (opposite of size reduction) is not a mechanical operation. 2. Wear and tear in wet crushing is more than that in dry crushing of materials. 3. A 'dust cher' is simply an enlargement in a pipeline which permits the solids to settle down due to reduction in velocity of the dust laden gas. 4.

During the crushing operation the two rolls rotate toward each other resulting in crushing. The feed particle size determines the type of rollers used. Rollers with teeth are able to grip large particles making it possible to crush blocks of considerable size in rolls of moderate diameter.
