 · The same roller mill was used for all configurations with the appropriate lower rolls completely open when using 2 or 3 sets of rolls. Grinding rate (tonnes/hour) was greatest ( P <0.05) for the 2-high and 4-high coarse configurations followed by the 3-high configuration and lowest for the 4-high fine configuration.
