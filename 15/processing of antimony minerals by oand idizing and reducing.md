## Recovery of Antimony: A Laboratory Study on the Thermal 
Antimony is typically classiﬁed as a volatile heavy metal and low-grade ores are commonly produced by pyrometallurgical methods [20]. Industrially reduction of antimony oxide to metallic antimony is achieved by heat-ing and the addition of carbon in a reverberatory furnace. Volatilization of antimony can be reduced by the addition

## Removal of Arsenic and Antimony from Anode Slime by Vacuum 
 · Anode slime is an important material of recycling precious metals. Up to now treating the arsenic- and antimony-rich anode slime by conventional processes has the following problems: its economic and environmental effect is less than satisfactory and the removal effect of arsenic and antimony from anode slime in present processes is not all that could be desired.

Antimony. Antimony is a semimetallic chemical element which can exist in two forms: the metallic form is bright silvery hard and brittle; the non metallic form is a grey powder. Antimony is a poor conductor of heat and electricity it is stable in dry air and is not attacked by dilute acids or alkalis.
