## How to Adjust the Fineness of Flour Milling Machinery?
 · To adjust the milling fineness of a flour machine we must understand that the unit of fineness is "mesh" and the "mesh" of a flour machine is between 30 and 500. We can adjust within this range and the flour The output and fineness of the machine are affected by the density of the material so the density of the material must be considered when adjusting the fineness.

A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill. A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls usually stone or metal which grinds material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls. Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%.
