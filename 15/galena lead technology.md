## Propose a technological chain for the production of lead 
 · The production of lead from the mineral galena PbS proceeds along the following chain. Combustion reaction. PbS -> PbO -> Pb. 2PbS + 3O2 = 2SO2 + 2PbO. When lead sulfide interacts with oxygen the result is sulfur oxide and lead oxide. PbO + CO = Pb + CO2. When lead oxide and carbon monoxide react lead and carbon dioxide are produced.
