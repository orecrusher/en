 · The length by which the tool extends from the toolholder is a variable that can be used to 'tune' the machining process. Contrary to what you may expect increasing the tool's L:D ratio may reduce chatter and result in more productive milling.

## Introduction to Rotor Dynamics 
Usually the critical speeds are desired to be 10% to 20% above or below the operating speed range. However there are many rotors that operate on top of the second critical speed due to sufficient bearing damping. Often attempts to elevate the 2nct critical speed by increased bearing stiffness leads to serious 1st mode stability problems.

 · This means that your upload speed is irrelevant for day-to-day web use which is just as well because it's usually a lot slower than your download speed. Broadband providers know that downloading is more important so they configure their system to give that priority. Where it does matter is when you're uploading large amounts of data.
