Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source local environmental regulations and other factors.. As in all mining operations the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## Supergene (geology) 
In ore deposit geology supergene processes or enrichment are those that occur relatively near the surface as opposed to deep hypogene processes. Supergene processes include the predominance of meteoric water circulation with concomitant oxidation and chemical weathering.The descending meteoric waters oxidize the primary sulfide ore minerals and redistribute the metallic ore elements.

Metallic Deposits. Metals occur in all kinds of rocks but usually in concentrations that are too low to be mined. Metallic ore deposits however are relatively rare concentrations of metal‐bearing minerals (usually sulfides) that contain enough metal to be profitably mined. Again the profit line is dependent on a number of economic factors.

rock formations that form large plateaus. Iron-ore in north Sweden copper and nickel deposits in Ontario Canada iron nickel chromites and platinum in South Africa are examples of minerals found in igneous and metamorphic rocks. Sedimentary rock formations of plains and young fold mountains contain non-metallic minerals like limestone.

They occur in both sedimentary and igneous rocks. The outer 10 km of the crust contains 33 g of copper for every tonne of rock. This is not enough to make it commercially viable to extract the rock. Copper mines are only set up where there is more than 5 kg of copper per tonne of rock (0.5% by mass). Ideally the figure should be closer to 2%.

## How Hydrometallurgy and the SX/EW Process Made Copper the 
Beginning in the mid 1980s a new technology commonly known as the leach-solvent extraction-electrowinning process or SX/EW Process was widely adopted. This new copper technology utilizes smelter acid to produce copper from oxidized ores and mine wastes. Today worldwide approximately 20% of all copper produced is produced by this is process.
