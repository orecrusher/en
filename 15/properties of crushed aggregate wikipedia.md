## Properties and Performance of Concrete Made with Recycled 
 · This low rate of brick recycling is due to a lack of understanding about the performance of crushed brick material as aggregate in concrete or road base. In the case of concrete the high water absorption of crushed brick and its relatively low compression strength in comparison with natural aggregate makes it difficult to meet traditional concrete specifiions.

## Aggregates for Concrete
Aggregates may be broadly classi fied as natural or artificial both with respect to source and to method of preparation. Natural sands and gravels are the product of weathering and the action of wind or water while manufactured crushed fine aggregate and crushed stone coarse and fine aggregate are produced by crushing natural stone.

Crushed stoneCrushed stone or angular rock is a form of construction aggregate typically produced by mining a suitable rock deposit and breaking the removed rock down to the desired size using crushers. It is distinct from gravel which is produced by natural processes of weathering and erosion and typically has a more rounded shape.

Crushed rock creates a much better bond between the paste and the aggregate than a gravel does. However the aggregate-mortar bond may be more important in flexure tests than in compression tests. The mineral makeup of the aggregate also influences the modulus of elasticity of concrete.
