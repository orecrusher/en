iron is present it has all been oxidized and is being removed in the filtration process. If iron is found in the filtrate oxidation has not been complete and some of the iron will pass through the filter and end up in the treated water. In this case the operator should consider adjustments to the oxidation process.

## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics
 · HistoryIron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore leaving behind a soft malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.
