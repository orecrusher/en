Crushing in an impact crusher takes place when the stone is struck by the spinning impact bars and by that stone being flung against an apron. When impact crushing is used the striking of the aggregate by the spinning rotor's blow bars knocks off or breaks the elongated fractures. This process is repeated by an impactor in the secondary stage.

## Crushers 
In most crushing installations a jaw crusher takes care of primary crushing. Plants with very high capacities that are common in mining and less popular in aggregates production normally use a primary gyratory crusher. When the processed material is easy to crush and not very abrasive an impact crusher may be the best choice for primary crushing.
