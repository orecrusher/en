## Concrete Cracking 
Demolition of concrete masses is made by bursting and crunching methods. Bursting is often called hydraulic bursting as it uses hydraulic controlled machines to do the job. Bursting is ideally done for the solid concrete structures such as huge pillars walls and pile caps whereas Crunching is done at confined spaces where noise is restricted.

## Bursting 
Hydraulic Bursting is one of the safest and most efficient methods of removing reinforced or mass concrete brickwork or natural stone. Hydraulic Bursters are placed in pre-drilled holes and expanded to induce controlled cracking of the material. Thus reducing it to manageable sections for removal.

## Investigation and Improvement of Bursting Force Equations 
 · In posttensioned concrete members the high local stress under the anchorage causes transverse tensile stress. Therefore it is very important to predict the bursting force to determine appropriate reinforcement details. In the present work the existing equations of the bursting force for the anchorage zone were evaluated and an equation for the bursting force based on finite element
