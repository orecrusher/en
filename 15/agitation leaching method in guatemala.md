## Leaching Equipment 
Leaching Equipment. There are two primary egories of contacting method according to which leaching equipment is classified: (1) leaching may be accomplished by percolation and (2) the particulate solids may be dispersed into a liquid phase and then separated from it. Each may be operated in a batch or continuous manner.

## Autoclaves and agitator systems for hydrometallurgy 
Autoclave technology is used in hydrometallurgy when extraction by classical atmospheric leaching methods is not economical. Autoclaves are typically horizontal vessels divided into 3 to 9 compartments or a series of single cascading vessels working at high temperature and high pressure. Extreme temperatures as well as fluctuating pressure

## The process design of gold leaching and carbon
Leaching reagents in the form of cyanide and an oxidant such as air or oxygen are added after thickening. Leaching takes place in a series of agitated leach reactors or pachucas. Before leaching the pH of the pulp is normally adjusted to a value of around 9.5–11 to ensure minimum loss of cyanide as hydrogen cyanide.

Biooxidation: Biooxidation is a process by which the recovery of a metal is enhanced by microbial decomposition of the mineral but the target metal is not necessarily solubilized. •In bioleaching the desired metal is leached from the ore. In biooxidation the

Vat leaching can be considered when an ore body does not have the grade or quantity to be a candidate for normal agitation leaching and as an alternative to heap leaching. At a loion where there is excessive rainfall such as more than 120 in./yr or even a short and intense rainy season on the order of 50 in. the solution in heap leaching can become seriously diluted.

## Leaching (chemistry) 
Leaching is the process of a solute becoming detached or extracted from its carrier substance by way of a solvent.. Leaching is a naturally occurring process which scientists have adapted for a variety of appliions with a variety of methods. Specific extraction methods depend on the soluble characteristics relative to the sorbent material such as concentration distribution nature and size.

## Solid
Leaching occurs in two steps: 1. Contacting solvent and solid to effect a transfer of a solute (leaching). 2. The separation of the solution from the remaining solid (washing). Factors influencing the rate of extraction: There are four important factors to be considered: 1. Particle size. 2. Solvent. 3. Temperature. 4. Agitation of the fluid.
