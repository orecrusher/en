## Scalping Screens 
Typically scalping is the first step in the screening process. Large particles subject the vibrating screen deck to intense wear and strain due to significant drop heights and high tonnage. Kwatani scalping screens efficiently remove the excess over or under sized large or small material before feeding into crushers mills or other comminution machines in the downstream process.

## Robust screens custom 
 · "Scalping is usually one of the first steps in the comminution process which subjects screens to intense strain and wear" she says. "We therefore design our scalping screens for high drop heights large sizes of material and considerable throughput tonnages which can handle up to 7000 tonnes of heavy run-of-mine material ore per hour."
