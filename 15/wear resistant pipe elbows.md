## Delay Abrasive Wear : Plastics Technology
The good news is that you can minimize the effect of abrasive materials in two broad ways: Install wear-resistant components especially elbows and reduce material velocities. Focus on bends Given the right conditions conveyed material generally travels straight down the center of pipes within a stream of air—except in bends specifically "elbows" or within the curved walls of receivers.

 · In the most abrasive positions standard 152mm (6") steel pipe elbows could last as little as three to four weeks. Rubber-lined pipes only increased the life to five weeks and didn't justify the increase in cost. It was evident the constant pipe change-outs were causing significant downtime and labour costs to the plant.

A wear resistant elbow is only as good as its weakest point. Putting in a wear resistant elbow made of very thin walled tube material – or using threaded pipe ends – means that elbow will only be in the system for as long as it takes the tube to wear out underneath the compression coupling – or for the pipe threads to wear out.

## Appliion of wear resistant ceramic elbow in 
Wear resistant ceramic elbow is a kind of composite pipe which can save energy reduce emission wear and corrosion. According to the different wear conditions of the project the thickness of alumina ceramic lining of the pipeline will be different. There are essential differences between wear-resistant ceramic elbow and traditional steel pipe

Patented EXTRABEND Pipe Elbows offer a substantially innovative geometry suitable aiming at wear reduction during operation in all types of dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems. The body cavity next to the point of diversion generates an internal turbulence of the material which protects the pipe elbow from wear caused by the material travelling through the duct.

## Wear
Hydraulic piping should be protected from wear along its entire length. In pneumatic conveyance systems experience shows that most wear occurs in pipe bends and in the piping immediately beyond them. For this reason wear-proof piping with internal lining is used at such loions.

Wear resistant elbows are composed of three layers: ceramic intermediate and steel layers. The ceramic layer is formed by molten alumina at a temperature above 2500 degree. The molten alumina produced from the reaction Fe2O3+2Al=2Fe+Al2O3 spreads on the inside wall of the steel pipe under the influence of a centrifugal force then solidifies
