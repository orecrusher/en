## Ball Mills 
For more than 50 years vertical mills have been the mill of choice for grinding raw materials into raw meal. More recently they have become widely used for cement production. They have lower specific energy consumption than ball mills and the separator as in raw mills is integral with the mill body.

## Rawmill 
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into "rawmix" during the manufacture of cement. Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln which transforms it into clinker which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement

## Cement Raw Material Milling 
AC cement raw material milling is used to grind the hard nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills. This cement ball mill is mainly used to grind cement finished products and raw materials and also suited to metallurgical chemical electricity etc. as well as many other industrial mining enterprises.

## History of cement 
Use of ball mills to grind clinker and raw materials From the turn of the 20th century rotary cement kilns gradually replaced the original vertical shaft kilns used originally for making lime. Rotary kilns heat the clinker mainly by radiative heat transfer and this is more efficient at higher temperatures enabling higher burning temperatures to be achieved.
