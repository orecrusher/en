Abstract Pure manganese dioxide was successfully produced from low grade pyrolusite ore (β-MnO 2 ) and sulphur slag. First the reduction of β-MnO 2 introduced as pure pyrolusite was studied using different ratios of elemental sulphur at different temperature (300–400 °C) in air or in closed stainless tube. The reduction process was followed by leaching of Mn with H 2 O 0.1 0.5 or 1
