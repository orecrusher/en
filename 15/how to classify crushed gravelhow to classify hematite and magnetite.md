## The Beneficiation Techniques for 5 Types of Iron Ores in 
 · Magnetite accounts for 60% of the total reserves of iron ore in Vietnam. Compared with the iron ore required in industrial production magnetite has a lower grade and high exploitation cost. The Beneficiation process is guided by the principles of " more crushing and less grinding " " more energy-saving and low costs ".

Classifiion according to concrete class. The concrete class (MB) is the normed compressive strength in MPa based on the characteristic strength of concrete at the age of 28 days. The characteristic compressive strength is a value below which can be expected at most 10% of all compressive strengths of tested concrete (a 10 % fractile).

## Classifiion of Aggregates
Classifiion of Aggregates. The variability in density can be used to produce concrete of widely different unit weights see Table (1). The most common classifiion of aggregates on the basis of bulk specific gravity is lightweight normal-weight and heavyweight aggregates.

Hematite and magnetite are the most prominent iron ores. Most of the high-grade hematite iron ores (direct shipping ore (DSO)) are subjected to simple dry processes of beneficiation to meet size requirements. This involves multistage crushing and screening to obtain lump (− 31.5 + 6.3 mm) and fines (approximately − 6.3 mm) products.
