## Back to Basics Hammer Milling and Jet Milling Fundamentals
A hammer mill is typically good for grinding softer materials with Mohs hard-ness ranging from 1 to 5 while a jet mill can grind materials with Mohs hardness as high as 10. High hardness materi-als become very abrasive; therefore they are not suitable for high-speed hammer mills. In a typical jet mill grinding
