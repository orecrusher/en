## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron 
 · The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process. The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace. These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.

 · Iron is displaced from its ore (haematite) by carbon (from coke): 2Fe2O3 + 3C → 4Fe + 3CO2. Also displaced by carbon monoxide: Fe 2 O 3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO 2. Iron burns in hot air blast to form CO 2 (exothermic): C + O 2 → CO 2. At high temperatures in the furnaceCO 2 is reduced to CO: CO 2 + C → 2CO. Limestone reacts with impurities to form slag which is tapped off.

## Magnesium: extraction
Magnesium: extraction; Brife introduction; Magnesium is found in solution in sea-water (about 1.3 kg m-3 magnesium) and in natural brines. It is also found extensively in the ores magnesite (MgCO3) and dolomite (MgCO3.CaCO3). Both of the two types of resources can be used as raw materials to manufacture magnesium metal.
