## the importance of grind in mineral processing plant
 · Sino Grinding Mineral Processing. Mineral processing typically involves the crushing and grinding of hard rock ore. Crushed ore is introduced to semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mills also known as primary mills where grinding media is released like hammers to assist in the ore cracking / grinding process.

## Crushing in Mineral Processing
 · In mineral processing or metallurgy the first stage of comminution is crushing.. Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate/surface.

## Comminution 
Comminution is the reduction of solid materials from one average particle size to a smaller average particle size by crushing grinding cutting vibrating or other processes. In geology it occurs naturally during faulting in the upper part of the Earth's crust. In industry it is an important unit operation in mineral processing ceramics electronics and other fields accomplished with

## What is the purpose of crushing grinding and milling 
Crushing and Grinding are processes that work together to get the rock to be small enough so it can go to flotation. In flotation they objective is to separate the valuable ore from the waste rock. Crushing is the initial stage of comminution (the action of reducing a material) in mineral processing.
