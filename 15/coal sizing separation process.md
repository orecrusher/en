 · Sizing. Different cleaning processes are used on different sizes of coal. Therefore raw coal entering the plant will be screened (sieved) into three or four sizes. Clean coal is rarely sized except for some industrial markets. Storage and stockpiling. Coal is stored in silos or stockpiled before and after cleaning.

## Shaking Table 
Shaking tables are one of the oldest gravity separators in the mineral processing industry capable of handling minerals and coal of 0-2mm. Shaking tables are rectangular-shaped tables with riffled decks across which a film of water flows. The mechanical drive imparts motion along the long axis of the table perpendicular to the flow of the water.

 · Sink and Float separation process. One of the first commercial appliions of a medium to effect a sink-float separation used a fine silica sand suspension for treating anthracite coal and is known as the "Chance" process. The method used for cleaning the medium is decantation which limits the minimum grain size of the solid in the suspension.
