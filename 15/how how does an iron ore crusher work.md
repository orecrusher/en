 · These ores form a niche market with specialty smelters used to recover the iron titanium and vanadium. These ores are beneficiated essentially similar to banded iron formation ores but usually are more easily upgraded via crushing and screening. The typical titanomagnetite concentrate grades 57% Fe 12% Ti and 0.5% V2O5.

Merete Tangstad in Handbook of Ferroalloys 2013. 7.5.1 Basics of Reduction Processes. Manganese ores will always contain some iron oxides. Reduction of the iron oxides in the ore is probably almost complete when the temperature reaches 1200°C. The product will be a carbon-saturated iron alloy with an increasing content of manganese at increasing reductions in temperature.

 · Iron ores with lower iron content such as taconite are first processed to concentrate the iron level and drive off volatile impurities. The iron ore is dressed or crushed into 0.5-1 in. chunks which increases surface area for reactions. Magnetic separation is used to remove some of the undesirable minerals or gangue in the crushed ore.
