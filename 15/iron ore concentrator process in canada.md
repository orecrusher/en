## Mining 
In the processing stage the mined material is transformed into usable raw material. For iron ore this involves crushing the ore and then concentrating it in different ways for example by milling flotation or magnetic separation. At some sites the ore is processed further and pelletised for use in direct reduced iron (DRI) steelmaking.
