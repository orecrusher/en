 · Feroform rolls for cold rolling mills operate up to 450 °C. The benefits of the long-life Feroform rolls over rubber / PU rolls include: Feroform rolls reduce materials costs on-site. They last longer than rubber/PU by as much as 8 – 10 times. Feroform rolls thus avoid the need for frequent replacement thanks to their longer life.
