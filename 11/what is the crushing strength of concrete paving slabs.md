A 'slab' of mass concrete usually 100mm or 150mm thick is spread and compacted then allowed to set. A few days later (2-7 days depending on time of year and weather conditions) the paving is laid on a bedding material over the now solid concrete. A medium strength concrete is used in most appliions.

## Pavement Types Strength Runway Surfaces 
Pavement bearing strength is determined using California Bearing Ratio (CBR) to find out on the pavement classifiion number on each runway. As such there are 2 types of pavement types rigid and flexible for the classifiion. Cement-concrete pavement (rigid) are used for some movement areas but it can crack upon intense impact.

## Concrete Installation: When Is 
 · Concrete Installation: When Is Reinforcement Needed? What Are the Properties of Concrete? Concrete contains crushed rock and sand and these aggregates help concrete slabs resist damage caused by compression. However concrete's tensile strength is only about one-tenth of its compressive strength.

 · Determine the Pad's Thickness For example a 6-inch pad with a compression strength of 700 psi can support 1105 psi. If it was 7 inches thick it could support 1194 psi and if it was 12-inches thick it could support 1563 psi. Can a floor collapse from too much weight? Too much weight can make anything collapse.
