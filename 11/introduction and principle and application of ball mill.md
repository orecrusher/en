## Ball Mill 
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

## Utilitarianism 
Utilitarianism is a specific type of consequentialism that focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number. After you identify your options for action you ask who will benefit and who will be harmed by each. The ethical action would be the one that caused the greatest good for the most people or the least harm to the least number.
