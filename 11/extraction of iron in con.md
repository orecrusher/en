Iron is one of the most abundant metals of the Earth's crust. It occurs naturally in water in soluble form as the ferrous iron (bivalent iron in dissolved form Fe 2+ or Fe(OH) +) or complexed form like the ferric iron (trivalent iron: Fe 3+ or precipitated as Fe(OH) 3).The occurrence of iron in water can also have an industrial origin ; mining iron and steel industry metals corrosion etc.

## Care and Cleaning of Iron – Canadian Conservation 
Keep iron objects as free of dust and dirt as possible. Clean iron away from the storage area to avoid introducing iron-laden dust particles to the area. Do not clean museum objects down to bare iron unless appropriate. If the corrosion product is removed totally the iron can re-corrode and disfiguring orange spots of rust will result.

Extraction of Metals. Extraction of Iron.. Iron is extracted from its ore in the blast furnace.. The main iron ore is called haematite. Haematite is iron(III) oxide - Fe 2 O 3. The iron ore contains impurities mainly silica (silicon dioxide). Limestone (calcium carbonate) is added to the iron ore which reacts with the silica to form molten calcium silie in the blast furnace.

## How iron is made 
The process of extracting iron from ore produces great quantities of poisonous and corrosive gases. In practice these gases are scrubbed and recycled. Inevitably however some small amounts of toxic gases escape to the atmosphere. A byproduct of iron purifiion is slag which is produced in huge amounts.
