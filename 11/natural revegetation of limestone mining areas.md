Abstract The performance of introduced species when interacting with colonising herbs and shrubs from the surrounding areas has become an important issue in plant ecology and restoration management. In this paper we examined the influence of hydroseeding a commercial seed mixture on the revegetation of uranium mine wastes under a semi-arid Mediterranean climate in West-Central Spain.
