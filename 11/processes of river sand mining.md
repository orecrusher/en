## River Sand Mining and Mining Methods 
 · In rivers construction grade sand occurs in different sources—active channels floodplains and river terraces. Different mining methods (mechanical or manual) are adopted for the extraction of sand from these sources under dry (above water table) and/or wet (below water table) conditions. This chapter describes briefly the different sources

minerals commonly mined in Missouri include limestone clay and some sandstone and granite. Most industrial minerals are mined from "open pits" – like the quarry-type operations you are most familiar with. However sand and gravel can be mined from either open pits only in river floodplains or from sand and gravel bars loed along streams.

 · Reason 2: River sand mining causes tailings. In the process of mining river sand it often produces a large amount of tailings which is not used reasonably. Especially in small mines the tailings are piled up at random occupying land and polluting the environment. Reason 3: A lot of construction waste is wasted.

Oil sand mining has a large impact on the environment. Forests must be cleared for both open-pit and in situ mining. Pit mines can grow to more than 80 meters depth as massive trucks remove up to 720000 tons of sand every day. As of September 2013 roughly 895 square kilometers (345 square miles) of land had been disturbed for oil sand mining.
