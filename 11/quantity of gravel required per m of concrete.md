## How To Calculate Water Content For 1 m³ M25 Concrete
Cement required for 1 m³ of M25 grade concrete is 9.51 bags. ( Standard data) As we know 1 bag of cement contains 50 kg of cement. ∴ 9.5150 = 476 Kg of cement. Let's assume that the water cement ratio is 0.5. Water content = 476 Kg x 0.5 = 238 Kg. ∴ Water content = 5×238/100 + 238 = 250 litres.
