## Car Buffing 
Car Buffing - foam pads and wool mops. Because the wool pad cuts the paintwork it will leave swirl marks. It is abrasive and anything that cuts will not leave the surface smooth it will leave its own fine scratches which can be seen in harsh light. So the process of removing swirl marks (buffer marks) begins by using a polishing pad.
