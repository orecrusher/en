Mining. The ore is removed from the ground in either open pit or underground mines. Underground – sinking a vertical shaft into the earth to reach the copper ore and driving horizontal tunnels into the ore. Open-pit – 90% of ore is mined using the open pit method. Ores near the surface can be quarried after removal of the surface layers.
