## In which industry is Bauxite mainly used?
Aluminum which is obtained from Bauxite ore is the perfect material to use when manufacturing airplanes as It is strong lightweight predictable and inexpensive. Steel and iron are both stronger than aluminum but the problem with steel and iron is its weight. Both of these metals are much heavier than aluminum — and too much weigh restricts an airplane's ability to takeoff and fly.
