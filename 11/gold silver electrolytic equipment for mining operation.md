SILVER ORES : Even though certain silver bearing ores contain silver none of them contain silver as their major constituent. A distinct ore might contain 0.085 percent silver 0.5 percent lead 0.5 percent copper and 0.3 percent antimony and after flotation separation the concentrate would contain 1.7 percent silver 10 to 15 percent lead 10 to 15 percent copper and 6 percent antimony.
