Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants bituminous coal subbituminous coal or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam which drives a turbine which produces electricity. In 2019 about 23 percent of

Coal mining occurs at the surface or underground by methods that are described in the "Earth's Minerals" chapter (figure 9). Mining especially underground mining can be dangerous. In April 2010 twenty-nine miners were killed at a West ia coal mine when gas that had accumulated in the mine tunnels exploded and started a fire.

Coal is a rich source of energy formed from plants that grew in swamps tens to hundreds of millions of years ago. The plants were buried deeply under younger and younger layers of dirt and rock heated and compressed into a carbon-rich rock.

## Thirst for power: improving water efficiency in coal
 · Around 53% of US coal plants use once-through cooling and 40% wet-recirculating systems. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that dry-cooling facilities produce around 7% less power than wet-recirculating plants; hence under 1% of units use this technology. Water also plays a pivotal role in coal mining and transportation.
