## Green Energy Reality Check: It's Not as Clean as You Think 
 · Embodied energy use starts with the fuel used by giant mining machines such as the 0.3 mpg erpillar 797F which can carry 400 tons of ore. There are also energy costs for electricity at the mine site (in remote areas often diesel-powered) to run machines that crush rocks as well as the energy costs in producing and using chemicals for refining.

Extracting iron from iron ore. In the 12th century men started to mine iron ore from rock. They learnt how to recognize rock that contained iron ore and broke off pieces of rock by lighting fires against it to make it brittle. The work was done from the surface down excavating the rock in opencast mines and following the veins of ore.

## Iron Ore Mining 
Iron ore is the unrefined substance utilized to formulate pig iron which is one of the most important untreated materials to compose steel. 98% of the hauled out iron ore is used to produce steel. Uncontaminated iron ore is almost nameless on the exterior of the Earth apart from the combination of Fe-Ni alloys from meteorites and very atypical forms of unfathomable mantle xenoliths.
