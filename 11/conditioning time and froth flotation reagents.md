## Sodium Disecbutyl Dithiophosphate 
Sodium disecbutyl dithiophosphate (DSP-04) is an aqueous solution of dialkyl dithiophosphate. It has little or no frothing properties. It is a selective collector towards iron sulphides in an alkaline circuit usually at slightly lower pH than for xanthates. The main appliion of this reagent is in the flotation of copper sulphides in the

 · How much Flotation Sulphidizer is needed Sulphidizers are usually fed into the conditioner just ahead of the flotation circuit. The quantity required varies with the characteristics of the ore and may range from.5 to 5 lbs. per ton. Conditioning time should be carefully determined and an excess of sulphidizing reagent avoided.
