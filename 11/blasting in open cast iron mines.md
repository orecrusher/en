## Analysis of the blast
Blasting in opencast mines is characterized by the use of large masses of explosives for a single blast. Blasting is done in a series of several to tens or even hundreds of charges placed in long holes and fired with a millisecond delay. Works are often carried out in the vicinity of buildings; therefore reducing vibration impact is essential for opencast mines.

## Cast Blast Design 
Cast blasting is a type of blast design which utilizes the surplus explosive energy to move overburden material across the pit. It is most frequently employed in coal mines to remove overburden from above the coal seam. This is achieved by arranging pits in long and narrow configurations that facilitate the movement of the blasted rock into the
