## How concrete is made 
A ball mill is a rotating drum filled with steel balls of different sizes (depending on the desired fineness of the cement) that crush and grind the clinker. Gypsum is added during the grinding process.

## ROLLING 
Production of Steel Balls (a) Production of steel balls by the skew-rolling process. (b) Production of steel balls by upsetting a cylindrical blank. Note the formation of flash. The balls made by these processes subsequently are ground and polished for use in ball bearings.

## Hybrid ceramic ball bearings 
MRC Hybrid ceramic ball bearings use a combination of traditional 52100 steel rings precision matched with silicon nitride (ceramic) balls. In addition to being excellent electric insulators hybrid bearings have a higher speed capability and will provide longer service life than all-steel bearings in most appliions.

## How Ball Bearings are Made 
 · Who knows why steel balls were not machined from the very beginning to a principle similar to that of stone ball production. This production method guarantees for a large number of balls equal diameters when machined between two plates since only the ball contacting the upper and lower rotating surface simultaneously with a certain load can be ground.
