 · Research highlights Quarry dust (QD) used as partial substitute of sand and RHA as cement replacement. QD obtained as a by-product from the crushing process of granites. RHA enhanced the hardened mechanical properties of concrete. Minor decline in mechanical properties were observed due to QD inclusion. QD can be a viable substitute to sand in the presence of RHA to produce HSC.
