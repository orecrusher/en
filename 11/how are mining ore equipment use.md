## ASARCO » Mining
A number of mine plans based on different metal prices can be developed to help the mine better respond to changing market conditions. When the price of copper is high lower-grade ore can be cost-effectively mined along with the better grade ore. When the price is low the mining operations can focus on the higher grade ores.

Mill chemistry. The crushed and ground ore or the underground ore in the case of ISL mining is leached with sulfuric acid: UO 3 + 2H + ====> UO 2 2+ + H 2 O UO 2 2+ + 3SO 4 2-====> UO 2 (SO 4) 3 4-. The UO 2 is oxidised to UO 3.. With some ores carbonate leaching is used to form a soluble uranyl tricarbonate ion: UO 2 (CO 3) 3 4-.This can then be precipitated with an alkali e.g. as sodium

The iron ore coke and limestone are crushed into small round pieces and mixed and put on a hopper which controls the input. The most common ores of iron are hematite Fe 2 O 3 and magnetite Fe 3 O 4. These ores can extract iron by heating them with the carbon present in the coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.
