## Calcium Oxide 
Calcium oxide is typically made by the thermal decomposition of materials such as seashells or limestone that have calcium carbonate (CaCO₃; inorganic calcite) in a lime kiln. This is achieved by heating the material to above 835 °C (1517 °F) a process is known as calcination or lime-burning to release a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO₂) leaving quicklime.
