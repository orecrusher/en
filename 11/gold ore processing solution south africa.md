Typical appliions are leaching of gold ores with cyanide chemical and wastewater treatment processes where large amounts of gases are required to be dissolved in fluids. The reactor is especially efficient for high rate oxidation of sulphides since the slurry (solution stream) is accelerated at the gas addition point and this increases shear rates in the subsequent flow mixing zone.
