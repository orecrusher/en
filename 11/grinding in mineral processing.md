Usually the grinding circuit contains at least two interconnected mills with material classifiers (e.g. cyclones) separating the fine material from the coarse (that then goes for regrinding). The process is energy intensive with power consumption of roughly 20 to 30 MW and feed throughputs of 2500 to 3000 t/hr. Process variables are mill loads motor torque and power plus pressures and

This process is called 'comminution' or 'size reduction'. Comminution may be carried out on either dry materials or slurries. Most mineral processing operations are conducted with water as the medium. This is called wet processing against dry processing. Crushing grinding milling and vibration (feeding) are examples of comminution

## Ore Sorting Strategies In Mineral Processing
For successful mineral processing design it's critical to evaluate the possibility of preconcentration or waste diversion before grinding. Mess up this step and you could be hit with avoidable downstream CAPEX and OPEX costs. At its core preconcentration means exploiting particle differences as early as possible so that waste material isn't unnecessarily fed to the mill and then deposited
