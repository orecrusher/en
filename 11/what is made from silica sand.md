To make calcium silie bricks silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand–lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170°C (340°F) for several hours. Some gel similar to the calcium silie hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement is formed and this bonds the sand particles together.
