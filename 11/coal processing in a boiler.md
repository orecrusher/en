## What is a Boiler and How Does it Work? 
 · Coal is a standard fuel source. In industrial boiler appliions the coal tends to be ground to a fine powder as it burns more completely than traditional bricks. Electric can be used as a heat source either by resistance heating coils or electrode units. Electric would normally only be used for smaller commercial or domestic use.

## What is boiler 
What is boiler? It is an enclosed pressure vessel in which water is converted into steam by gaining heat from any source (coal oil gas etc). Boiler in thermal power plant accumulates the steam and build up a pressure to expend it in turbine and convert thermal energy to mechanical energy. The generator which is connected to turbine converts the mechanical energy into electric energy.

TVA - How a Coal Plant Works. Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced under tremendous pressure flows into a turbine which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.
