Selecting the correct filter for the tailings is critical. Some tailings can be sufficiently dewatered using a vacuum filter while other more difficult tailings require pressure filtration. The geotechnical properties of the stacked tailings will drive to what degree the tailings must be filtered.

Copper Tailing an overview ScienceDirect Topics Copper tailings are a finely ground waste after copper mineral has been extracted from the ores during beneficiation. Similar to CS the use of copper tailings as a geotechnical material has also been reported in the literature but on a relatively smaller scale ( Collins and Ciesielski 1994; Gupta and Thomas 2013; Nitish et al. 2013; Miller

## Mine Tailings 
Mine tailings are the finely ground residue from ore extraction. The grain size of the tailings depends on the nature of the ore and the milling process. Size measurements (Robertson 1994) of tailings from four mines in Ontario Canada indied the tailings materials to be predominantly silt and fine to medium sand with <10% clay content.

This means that 95.7% of the copper present in the ore was recovered in the concentrate while the rest was lost in the tailings.
