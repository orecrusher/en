## The process design of gold leaching and carbon
Before leaching the pH of the pulp is normally adjusted to a value of around 9.5–11 to ensure minimum loss of cyanide as hydrogen cyanide. The leaching of gold can be conveniently represented by the Elsener equation: [1] Although air agitated leach tanks were commonly used in the industry mechanically agitated reactors are preferred due

Appliion Of Leaching Kinetics Modelling To A. Gold is produced from its ores by cyanide leaching. The cyanide leaching process is applied by first grinding the ore below 75 micrometers and dissolving gold as AuCN 2-by mixing the ground ore with dilute cyanide solution to obtain slurry above pH 10 and by providing oxygen to the leaching tanks.
