## Extraction of Gold
Smelting Process of Gold The smelting process consists in the formation of an alloy of gold with silver and lead and is similar to that employed in extracting silver. It is applicable to ores rich in silver and also to refractory ores containing arsenic and antimony for which the other processes are unsuitable.

The process works best when the ore is crushed to small pieces before roasting. Additives such as common rock salt are often added to the mix before it is heated to enhance the reaction of the sulfides. Once the ores are fully roasted and the sulfur is driven off the extraction of the gold or silver from the ore is not especially difficult.
