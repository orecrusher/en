Rod mills are very similar to ball mills except they use long rods for grinding media. The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill. To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.
