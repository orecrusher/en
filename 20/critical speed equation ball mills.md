 · The mill was rotated at 63% of the critical speed. The position of the balls at the end of five revolutions is shown in Figure 2. It is seen that using a low coefficient of friction at the walls balls tend to flow down the surface of the charge and a "toe" begins to form. As the friction at the wall increases aracting motion is observed.

## Critical Speed 
Critical speed is the first resonant frequency (speed) of the rotating shaft. Resonance in a rotating shaft can be astrophic and even break the shaft. However not all ball screws will necessarily exhibit such behavior since the nut represents another support of the shaft permanently changing the unsupported length of the shaft and its resonant frequency.

Investigations were carried out in a laboratory ball mill having the size of DxL = 160x200 mm with a ribbed inside surface of the drum. The mill ball loading was 40% by volume the rotation rate was equal to 85% of the critical speed. Balls were made from steel: S4146 extra high quality having hardness 62 ± 2 HRC according to Rockwell.
