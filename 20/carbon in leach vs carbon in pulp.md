 · Activated carbon also consumes cyanide so its effect has to be accounted for in the case of carbon-in-leach (CIL) or carbon-in-pulp (CIP) plant flowsheets. Since cyanide is an expensive reagent often a major component of plant operating costs it is important that the scale-up of cyanide consumption from laboratory to plant be representative.
