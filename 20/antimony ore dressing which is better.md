## Antimony 
Antimony is sometimes found in pure form. It is also obtained from the mineral stibnite (antimony sulfide) and commonly is a by-product of lead-zinc-silver mining. Other antimony-bearing minerals include sibiconite tetrahedrite and ullmannite. It is mined in China Bolivia South Africa and Mexico.

Antimony is a member of group 15 of the periodic table one of the elements called pnictogens and has an electronegativity of 2.05. In accordance with periodic trends it is more electronegative than tin or bismuth and less electronegative than tellurium or arsenic.Antimony is stable in air at room temperature but reacts with oxygen if heated to produce antimony trioxide Sb 2 O 3.
