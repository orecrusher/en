Clean the metal with soap and water to get rid of any surface contaminants. With power turned off attach the positive lead (+) from the power source to the piece of metal. This is called the sacial anode. It is an anode because it is connected to positive. It is sacial because it will rust away during the electrolysis process.

## extraction of metal using electrolysis
The reactivity of a metal determines how it is extracted. Metals above carbon in the reactivity series must be extracted using electrolysis. Metals less reactive than carbon can be extracted from their ores by reduction. Copper silver gold and platinum can occur in their pure form natively and do not need to be extracted.
