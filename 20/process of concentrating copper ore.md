The process of liberation of copper ores depends upon whether they are oxide or sulfide ores. Subsequent steps depend on the nature of the ore containing the copper. For oxide ores a hydrometallurgical liberation process is normally undertaken which uses the soluble nature of the ore minerals to the advantage of the metallurgical treatment plant.

## How Hydrometallurgy and the SX/EW Process Made Copper the 
Beginning in the mid 1980s a new technology commonly known as the leach-solvent extraction-electrowinning process or SX/EW Process was widely adopted. This new copper technology utilizes smelter acid to produce copper from oxidized ores and mine wastes. Today worldwide approximately 20% of all copper produced is produced by this is process.
