Abstract: The name Azara has become synonymous with artesanal mining of baryte in Nigeria. This activity turned into a lucrative business immediately after the abandonment of the mechanized method of mining in the 80s. Ever since then the exploration of barite in Azara has been manual characterized by the use of primitive tools such as diggers and shovels usually on a small scale.
