Raw materials of the cement plant are mostly from open-pit mines and the ore size of large mines can reach 1.5-1.8m. In the preparation of cement raw materials we first need to crush limestone gypsum clay and other materials into proper size to facilitate the subsequent transportation and storage at the same time make full preparations for the next process (cement raw materials grinding).

In the case of raw materials attempts have always been made to minimise the amount of crushing needed by extracting the rock in the finest possible state. In the chalk areas chalk was until well into the twentieth century quarried by hand and by a process termed "milling" chalk was scratched from the quarry face producing material that was mostly 30 mm or smaller.
