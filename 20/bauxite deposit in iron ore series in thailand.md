## Bauxite 
Bauxite (Fig. 1.33) is formed by surface weathering of clay rocks around the tropical region and composer of aluminum oxide (Al(OH) 3).It contains 15%–25% aluminum and only ore used for commercial extraction for aluminum. The bauxite occurs as near-surface layers and usually mixed with clay minerals iron oxide and titanium dioxide.

 · The Parnassos-Ghiona bauxite deposit in Greece of karst type is the 11th largest bauxite producer in the world. The mineralogical major and trace-element contents and δ18O δ12C δ34S isotopic compositions of bauxite ores from this deposit and associated limestone provide valuable evidence for their origin and biogeochemical processes resulting in the beneficiation of low grade bauxite ores.
