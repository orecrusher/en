## A SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCES RELATED TO COMBUSTION 
• Coal fineness is ascertained by collecting a representative coal sample from each burner line and shaking the sample through a series of sieves. • Coal fineness samples should be collected from all fuel lines of a specific pulverizer. The pulverizer fineness is considered the weighted average of all fineness samples collected.

To summarize the coal mill controls they may be divided basically into two major egories:. 1. To control the quality of coal being sent to the burners loed on the furnace walls. The word quality here means the temperature and fineness of the PF. The set temperature values are dependent on the percentage of volatile matter that exists in the main fuel.
