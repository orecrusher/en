## How HPGRs compare to conventional milling
 · Within comminution circuits High Pressure Grinding Rolls (HPGR) are increasingly replacing conventional SAG rod and ball mills for hard rock reduction – owing to their substantially lower energy consumption and potential for significant total cost of ownership reduction. Not only do they require as much as 40% less energy than traditional reduction methods but their wearable

## MEI's Barry Wills: The impact of milling costs on total 
 · It has been shown for example that the replacement of a SAG mill with a HPGR in a conventional SAG-ball circuit may reduce grinding energy consumption by 15–20%. Taking into account additional savings such as media and liner wear it was found that a grinding cost saving of 25–35% was potentially achievable with the use of HPGRs in such conventional circuits.

Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.
