## Opencast Mining (Quarrying): Methods Advantages 
Opencast mining or quarrying of minerals is easier than mining by underground methods. During quarrying the alluvium and rocks below which the minerals lie are removed and dumped in the initial stages in a place which is not required in future for quarrying residential or other purposes.
