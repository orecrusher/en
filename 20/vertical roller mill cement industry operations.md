## Operational experience from the United States' first 
 · Abstract: For several decades the cement industry has successfully utilized vertical roller mills (VRM) for grinding of raw materials and solid fuels. Most recently this technology has been employed for the combination of Portland cement blended cements and slag cements. The VRM offers several benefits compared to the ball mill in regards to operating costs and flexibility.
