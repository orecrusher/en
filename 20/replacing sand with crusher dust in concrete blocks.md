They have concluded the linear increase in compressive strength by replacing quarry dust upto 10 to 20% and observed decreasement if replaced more than 20 to 30% and Also optimization of cement content

## Can I use crusher dust instead of sand in concrete 
 · Can I use crusher dust instead of sand in concrete? From the experimental study it is concluded that the quarry dust can be used as a replacement for fine aggregate. It is found that 40% replacement of sand by quarry dust gives maximum result in strength compared to normal concrete and then decreases from 50%.

## CONCRETE MIX DESIGN USING CRUSHED SAND 
From technical point of view the rich mixes may lead to high shrinkage and cracking in the structural concrete and to evolution of high heat of hydration in mass concrete which may cause cracking. In this study we have used grit and crushed sand for the design mix and found the characteristic compressive strength at 37 and 28 days respectively.

Sahul Hameed and Sekar (2009) concluded that the compressive strength split tensile strength and the durability properties of concrete made of quarry rock dust are nearly 14% more than the conventional concrete.
