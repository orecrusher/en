## CHLORIDE HYPOCHLORITE OXIDATION AND LEACHING OF REFRACTORY 
For extraction of gold from the refractory ores in which gold is surrounded by sul-fide minerals oxidative pretreatment of the ore is essential to oxidize the sulfides and expose gold. Pyrometallurgical oxidation by roasting is encountered with environmen-tal limitations; thus hydrometallurgical methods are preferred. These methods include

## Mineralogy and Pretreatment of a Refractory Gold Deposit 
Cyanide leaching is a traditional and methodically developed process which is effective for extracting gold from refractory ores [ 30 ]. However cyanide has gradually been replaced by other lixiviants such as glycine and thiourea because of its strong toxicity and serious environmental damage [ 31 32 33 ].
