## Aggregate Crushing Value Test 
Aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load. Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions.

The aggregates crushing value test should be performed as per IS code 2386 Part IV. First fill the sample aggregate with one-third of the cylindrical measure in three layers. Each layer should be tamped 25times freely. After filling the sample aggregate weigh and record it as W1. Now fill the aggregate in the mould along with the plunger on top.

 · Aggregates with lower crushing value show a lower crushed fraction under load and would give a longer service life to the road and hence a more economical performance. If we used a weaker would get crushed under traffic loads would produce smaller pieces not coated with a binder and these would be easily displaced or loosened out resulting in loss of the surface/layer.
