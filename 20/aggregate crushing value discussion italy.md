## Sand Equivalent – Pavement Interactive
Sand equivalent values can vary widely depending upon aggregate source quarry washing and storage procedures. Typical sand equivalent values range from less than 30 to more than 90. Calcuations (Interactive Equation) Calculate the sand equivalent using the following equation: Where: sand reading = height of sand in cylinder (mm)

## Comparative environmental evaluation of recycled 
Aggregate impact value The large recycled aggregate is obtained by crushing concrete of which only the fraction with a nominal diameter between 5 mm and 20 mm has been extrapolated. The purpose of the study is to carry out a comparative environmental evaluation of recycled aggregates from CDW in Italy considering 5 mixtures of concrete.

We recommend a gravel no smaller than 10mm for pathways as anything smaller will easily wash away in heavy rain and become stuck in shoe treads. For driveways or pathways which will experience high traffic choose a hard wearing gravel such as granite basalt or flint to avoid eventual crushing down.

Aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load. Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions.

## Rock Aggregates and Its Suitability 
This may be assessed by tests of aggregate impact value (AIV) and aggregate crushing value (ACV). The common rock types range in AIV from good (basic volcanic dolerite quartzite. quartz gravels) through fair (granite gravels composed of igneous or metamorphic fragments) to poor (weathered igneous rocks clay-rich gravels).

 · If the aggregate crushing value is less than 10 it signifies an exceptionally strong aggregate. Whereas if the crushing value is 35 or above it would normally be considered as weak aggregate. After performing the test the crushed material is separated and calculated in terms of percentage of the original weight taken in the mould.

Aggregates may be broadly classi fied as natural or artificial both with respect to source and to method of preparation. Natural sands and gravels are the product of weathering and the action of wind or water while manufactured crushed fine aggregate and crushed stone coarse and fine aggregate are produced by crushing natural stone.
