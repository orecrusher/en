## Crushed Concrete Aggregates 
It is reported that coarse aggregate which comply with standards can be produced. However fine aggregates are larger and more angular than that used for concrete production. Consequently concrete produced with crushed concrete aggregate tend to be harsh and unworkable. Adding portion of natural sand would tackle this problem.
