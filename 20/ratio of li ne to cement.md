## How to mix cement to make mortar or concrete 
 · In terms of the ratio for concrete it depends on what strength you are trying to achieve but as a general guide a standard concrete mix would be 1 part cement to 2 parts sand to 4 parts aggregates. For foundations a mix of 1 part cement to 3 parts sand to 6 parts aggregates can be used.

This study examines the influence of the water to cement ratio (w/c) on the critical degree of saturation (DOSCR) of cement paste samples using length change measurements. Length change was measured using thermomechanical analysis (TMA) for cement paste samples with different degrees of saturation (DOS) ranging from 100% DOS to 0% DOS. The damage induced by a freezing and thawing cycle

Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement some kilns in the United States use a wet process.
