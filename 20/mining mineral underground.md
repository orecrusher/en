## Open Cut and Underground Mining 
Underground Mining is generally used for areas where the mineral seam is too far underground for open cut mining to be of use. A tunnel called a decline is created to allow workers and machinery to reach the loion of the minerals. Stope mining is used for most hard rock mining of minerals such as copper silver lead and zinc.

## Opencut Mining or Underground Mining 
 · Underground mining. Underground mining occurs underground through the creation of tunnels. These tunnels go deep into the mineral seam. This can be in excess of hundreds of metres. Tunnels are necessary to move equipment into the mineral zone. Coal is the largest portion of underground mining. It represents 60 percent of global coal production.

## Mining 
The minerals are valuable in their pure form but in the earth they are mixed with other unwanted rocks and minerals. This mix of rock and minerals is usually carried away from the mine together then later processed and refined to isolate the desired mineral. The two major egories of modern mining include surface mining and underground mining.
