Contaminated Sites. Tailings are a by-product of a gold mining process that was common in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Rocks that contained both gold and arsenic were crushed and then spread over liquid mercury to remove the gold. The mercury was then evaporated leaving the gold. The remaining sand-like substance is known as tailings.
