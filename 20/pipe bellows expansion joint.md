Pipe metal expansion bellows joints are necessary to ensure that the thermal expansion of the pipe is correctly directed to the metal expansion joint and to prevent buckling of the line. Additional guides are required loed next to the expansion joint due to the inherent flexibility of the bellows and the compressive load on the pipe produced by the pressure thrust of the joint expansion.

## LAYMAN'S GUIDE TO BELLOWS EXPANSION JOINTS
Essentially a bellows or expansion joint is a length of pipe with a series of convolutions that allow the pipe to move along one two or all three planes of movement. The convolutions give the expansion joint flexibility but they also need structural strength. This is why the design and manufacture of expansion joints is a specialised area and

Expansion joints are employed in piping systems to absorb different thermal expansion while containing the system pressure. They are successfully reduce both rated movement for a given life cycle and pressure capabilities of the expansion joint. Bellows operate best at normal pressure ratings temperatures between 70° C to 80° C.
