 · Iron is absorbed by plants in its soluble form as ferrous iron (Fe 2+). High concentrations of ferrous iron in the soil solution are observed at a low Eh with a rapid decrease when the Eh rises above + 350 mV (at pH 5) in relation to the formation of iron oxides and hydroxides (Frohne et al. 2011).
