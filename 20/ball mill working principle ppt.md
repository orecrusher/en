## Overview of our mills · Christian Pfeiffer
Ball mills are the classic grinding plants: Around the world they are the most common installations. Ball mills convince thanks to their simple principle and low maintenance needs: They are robust durable and extremely reliable in operation. By using ball mills in closed circuit with a separator their efficiency can be increased even further.

Among all top down approaches high energy ball milling has been widely exploited for the synthesis of various

## Working principle and efficient ways of ball mill 
Working principle:When the ball mill works motor and speed reducer transmit torque force to big and small gears of Ball Mill so the barrel rotates. When the barrel rotates Steel balls or other grinding media in the barrel are lifted to a certain height and fall down freely so materials in the barrel are impacted.

## Planetary Ball Mill 
Planetary Ball Mill Working Principle. Planetary Ball Mills consist of several cylindrical grinding jars (positioned on the sun wheel as shown on the figure) which are filled with loose grinding balls. Two superimposed rotational movements move the grinding jars: Like in a planetary system the grinding jar rotates on a orbit around the centre.

## Explain Construction And Working Of Ball Mill. 
 · Principle: Impact and Attrition. Construction: It consists of a hollow cylinder which is mounted on a metallic frame in such a way that it can be rotated on its longitudinal axis. The cylinder contains balls that occupy 30-50% of the mill volume. The ball size depends on the size of the feed and the diameter of the mill.

## The operating principle of the ball mill 
 · The operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps. In a continuously operating ball mill feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong being exposed by grinding media. The material grinding occurs during impact falling grinding balls and abrasion the particles between the balls. Then discharge of ground material performed
