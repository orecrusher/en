## A Look at the Process of Pelletizing Iron Ore for Steel 
Iron ore must go through a lengthy pre-processing stage before it can be pelletized – a series of steps that work to beneficiate and concentrate low-grade ores. This process varies depending on the ore source but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore.
