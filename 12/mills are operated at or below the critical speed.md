## Introduction to Rotor Dynamics 
Usually the critical speeds are desired to be 10% to 20% above or below the operating speed range. However there are many rotors that operate on top of the second critical speed due to sufficient bearing damping. Often attempts to elevate the 2nct critical speed by increased bearing stiffness leads to serious 1st mode stability problems.
