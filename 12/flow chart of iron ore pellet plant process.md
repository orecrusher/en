DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state i.e. without melting as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen coming from reformed natural gas syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.
