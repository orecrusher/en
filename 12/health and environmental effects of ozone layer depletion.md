## The human health effects of ozone depletion and 
Depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer has led to increased solar UV-B radiation ( nm) at the surface of the Earth. This change is likely to have had an impact on human exposure to UV-B radiation with consequential detrimental and beneficial effects on health although behavioural changes in society over the past 60 years or so with regard to sun exposure are of considerable importance.

Health and Environmental Effects of Ozone Layer Depletion. There are three types of UV light: UVA UVB and UVC. Reductions in stratospheric ozone levels will lead to higher levels of UVB reaching the Earth's surface. The sun's output of UVB does not change; rather less ozone means less protection and hence more UVB reaches the Earth.

## How Does Ozone Depletion Impact Human Health? 
 · How Does Ozone Depletion Impact Human Health? Basically ozone depletion refers to the gradual thinning of the ozone layer which is the natural filter that absorbs most of the burning UV rays coming from the sun. With the gradual depletion of this filter comes an increase in the intensity of UV rays hitting the earth's surface.
