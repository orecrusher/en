## How are rare ea rths mined? 
When mined rare earths are high lustre metals which are typically silver silver-white or grey in colour. When exposed to the air they tarnish and form oxide compounds. Rare earths when found in a large enough cluster are actually a 'cocktail' of elements which have to be separated into individual elements before they can be used commercially.
