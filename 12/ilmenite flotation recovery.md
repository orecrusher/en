ilmenite concentrate obtained contains 99.1% ilmenite with 3.5% yield and 94% recovery. The other heavy minerals including zircon (53.3%) and sillimanite (31.7%) could be further processed for recovery of individual mineral of zircon and sillimanite by judicious combination of gravity and flotation processes.

## Novel Approach for Fine Ilmenite Flotation Using 
Ilmenite disseminated grain size is relatively fine and it must be finely ground to fully separate ilmenite from gangue and then produce fine-grained minerals which deteriorates flotation. A novel method using buoyant carriers to improve the recovery of fine ilmenite in froth flotation was introduced in this study. Hydrophobized glass bubbles (HGB) as carrier materials were obtained by an

## 2017
AbstractThe flotation behaviors of ilmenite untreated or treated with lead ions using sodium oleate as a collector were studied. The results of micro-flotation experiments reveal that ilmenite shows good floatability at pH 6–8. Compared with the flotation recovery of ilmenite untreated with lead ions ilmenite floatability can be enhanced and the resulting increase in recovery can surpass

## Effect of microwave radiation on ilmenite flotation 
After exposure to microwave radiation for a short time ilmenite recovery was increased by about 20%. The specific surface area of ilmenite samples underwent a significant change with microwave exposure time; also new phases were observed. Microwave exposure speeded up the oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric ions on the ilmenite surface.

An ore of magnetite and ilmenite may however employ wet magnetic separation to remove magnetite and all flotation for recovery of the ilmenite in a high grade product. In this case all the gravity circuit including the jigs and tables can be eliminated. This scheme is also applicable on a rutile ore with little or no ilmenite.

## Effect of oxidation roasting on ilmenite flotation 
The maximum collector adsorption density occurred on ilmenite roasted at 600 °C which resulted in the increase of ilmenite flotation recovery from 73.5% to 91% at pH 6.3. This improvement was attributed to a greater conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+ ions and significant decrease in the zeta potential of ilmenite.
