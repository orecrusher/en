## Aggregate Crushing Value Test 
 · Aggregate Crushing value is a relative resistance of aggregates to crushing under gradually applied compressive load. Aggregate Crushing Value Test is important to test to be performed on aggregate. The strength of aggregate parent rock is determined by preparing cylindrical shape specimens of size 25 mm diameter and 25 mm height.
