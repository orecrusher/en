Steel material is supplied in two product forms – 'flat products' (steel plate and strip) and 'long products' (rolled sections either open beams angles etc or hollow sections). For structural use in bridges these products are inevitably cut (to size and shape) and welded one component to another.In the structure the material is subject to tensile and compressive forces.

Before the concrete is scooped into the moulds the moulds must be lightly coated in a mould release agent. This ensures that the concrete does not stick to the mould and makes it easier to remove the cube. When using a 150mm mould the concrete sample is scooped into the mould in 3 equal layers (50mm) and compacted between each layer.

## What is Poisson's ratio? 
Definition of Poisson's ratio Poisson's ratio is the ratio of transverse contraction strain to longitudinal extension strain in the direction of stretching force. Tensile deformation is considered positive and compressive deformation is considered negative. The definition of Poisson's ratio contains a minus sign so that normal materials have a positive ratio.

## Comparative study on the characteristics of ball
 · The ball mill was loaded with 10:1 (mass ratio) for the ball (10 mm ϕ) and the sample. To avoid the generation of high temperature from high-speed ball mill the milling time was set to 2-min working with 7-min breaks. To determine the effect of the ball-milling time the total duration of milling process varies from 100 to 4000 min.
