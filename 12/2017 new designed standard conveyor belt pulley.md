A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems.A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums) with a closed loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered moving the belt
