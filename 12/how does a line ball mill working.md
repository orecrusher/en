## Introduction to the Mill
Milling cutters with keyed holes are predominantly for use in horizontal mills. End mills are designed for cutting slots keyways and pockets. Two fluted end mills can be used to plunge into work like a drill. End mills with more than two flutes should not be plunged into the work. Ball end mills can produce a fillet.

## Milling Machine: Methods of Milling. Milling Processes 
 · Milling is an important process of manufacturing technology and basically it refers to the removal of metal from the work piece using a tool which has several cutting points and is rotating about its axis. Thus each cutting point removes a little bit of the metal but since there are multiple such points and the tool is rotating at a fast speed the overall removal is quite brisk.
