 · Health Effects. Health effects of nitrate in drinking water are most significantly linked to methemoglobinemia also known as "blue-baby syndrome." Baby formula mixed with nitrate-contaminated water exposes infants to nitrate. In infants 0-4 months old the nitrate is converted to nitrite in the infant's stomach.

## NITRATE IN LEAFY GREEN VEGETABLES AND ESTIMATED INTAKE
 · As such nitrate serves as a source via successive reduction for the production of nitrite and nitric oxide as well as other metabolic products. Nitrites are also produced endogenously through the oxidation of nitric oxide and through a reduction of nitrate by commensal bacteria in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract (Norman 2009).

Alternatively integrated nitric oxide production can be estimated from determining the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate end products. The measurement of nitrate/nitrite concentration or of total nitrate and nitrite concentration (NOx) is routinely used as an index of NO production [ 15 ].

 · Procedure. Inoculate nitrate broth with a heavy growth of test organism using aseptic technique. Incubate at an appropriate temperature for 24 to 48 hours. Add one dropper-full of sulfanilic acid and one dropper-full of an α-naphthylamine to each broth. At this point a color change to RED indies a POSITIVE nitrate reduction test.

 · Background Vegetables are the most important source of nitrates in the human diet. During various processes in the body nitrates are converted into nitrites which causes various diseases such as blue baby syndrome and cancer. This study aimed to determine the concentration of nitrates in several vegetable farms in Sanandaj city and to evaluate their health-related risks.

Nitrocellulose is also referred to as pyroxylin gun cotton or collodion although the last term (also listed as CAS No. ) is actually a solution of approximately 6% nitrocellulose 24% ethanol and 70% ether [1].
