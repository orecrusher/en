## Machining 101 — What is Grinding? 
 · Principles of Grinding. In all forms of grinding three different interactions occur between the abrasive and the machined material. Cutting occurs where the abrasive grain is sufficiently exposed to penetrate the workpiece material and curl a chip and sufficient clearance exists between the grain bond and workpiece to flush the chip with coolant or throw it away by wheel action.

A burr mill or burr grinder is a mill used to grind hard small food products between two revolving abrasive surfaces separated by a distance usually set by the user. When the two surfaces are set far apart the resulting ground material is coarser and when the two surfaces are set closer together the resulting ground material is finer and smaller.

I'm very much into wood working which involves some hand tool sharpening. In the sharpening world we're very familiar with abrasives. Some people use sandpaper taped to a piece of plate glass or a flat granite tile working from course (say 400) to fine (say P2000 wet). Other people use a wet stone which is basically a block of adhesived together Aluminum Oxide (the main ingredient/abrasive in

## 5 Horizontal Grinder Wear Parts to Inspect Regularly
 · Mill wear plates. All materials will be processed through the mill of a horizontal grinder. Over time the mill's metal wear plates will wear down. Loed on each side of the mill wear plates help prevent damage to the mill structure so you may only need to replace wear parts instead of rebuilding the whole milling area.

## Which Grinding Wheel Should I Choose? 
 · A grinding wheel is a precision tool with thousands of cutting points on its surface - abrasive grains that are held in place by a bond matrix (hence these are known as bonded abrasives) and separated by pores.. These pores are hollow spaces between abrasive grains and the bond which help with the clearance of discarded metal chips in the grinding process.
