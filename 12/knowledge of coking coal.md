## What Is Coals Value Knowledge 
Coal is being used in power generation the manufacturing of cement iron and steel. Coking coal is used to produce coke which in turn is used to produce pig iron. Coal used for energy generating is declining due to an increase in the use of natural gas and nuclear power. The overall coal production however is increasing for other purposes.
