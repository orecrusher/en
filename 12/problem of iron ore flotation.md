## The effects of partially replacing amine collectors by a 
Iron ore froth flotation has recently been used to obtain pure minerals due to the depletion of high-grade deposits. Amine collectors have often been used in ionic reverse iron ore flotation to achieve the separation with quartz impurities. The main problem associated with these collectors is related to the control of frothing properties and the high cost of amine reagents.
