The rate at which transpiration occurs refers to the amount of water lost by plants over a given time period. Plants regulate the rate of transpiration by opening and closing of stomata (Figure 5.14). There are however a number of external factors that affect the rate of transpiration namely: temperature light intensity humidity and wind.

Principles of Light. Every orchid grower knows that light intensity needs to be carefully managed for good plant growth and flowering. If the light levels are too low plants may not flower because there isn't enough energy to stimulate the flowering process. In addition new leaves that develop can be undesirably thin and growth can be weak.
