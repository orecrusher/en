Mill chemistry. The crushed and ground ore or the underground ore in the case of ISL mining is leached with sulfuric acid: UO 3 + 2H + ====> UO 2 2+ + H 2 O UO 2 2+ + 3SO 4 2-====> UO 2 (SO 4) 3 4-. The UO 2 is oxidised to UO 3.. With some ores carbonate leaching is used to form a soluble uranyl tricarbonate ion: UO 2 (CO 3) 3 4-.This can then be precipitated with an alkali e.g. as sodium

Talc ores also differ according to their mineralogical composition (i.e. the type and proportion of associated minerals present). They can be divided into two main types of deposits: talc-chlorite and talc-carbonate. Talc-chlorite ore bodies consist mainly of talc (sometimes 100%) and chlorite which is hydrated magnesium and aluminium silie.

 · Ball mills are a special instrument used to break up hard solids into a fine powder. They are similar to rock tumblers in that the instrument is a rotating container filled with heavy balls to grind the substance into powder. Ceramic material crystalline compounds and even some metals can be ground up using a ball mill.
