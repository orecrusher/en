Kinetic Energy of Rotation Consider a rigid object rotating about a fixed axis at a certain angular velocity. Since every particle in the object is moving every particle has kinetic energy. To find the total kinetic energy related to the rotation of the body the sum of the kinetic energy of every particle due to the rotational motion is taken.

Torque and speed of rotation The torque generated by the motor and its speed of rotation are dependent on each other. This is a basic characteristic of the motor ; it is a linear relationship and is used to calculate the no-load speed and the start-up torque of the motor. The curve for the output power of the motor is deduced from the graph of

 · For this reason rotational speed is typically set at a fixed value based on the size of the tools being used. If the rig has sufficient torque the speed can be increased to get higher penetration rates. Conversely if the head stalls under normal operation then the speed should be reduced to produce more torque and maintain steady rotation.
