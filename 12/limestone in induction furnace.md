## What's the function of limestone and Coke when added to 
The coke is a source of carbon monoxide which will reduce the iron oxide in the ore to iron and the carbon monoxide oxidizes to carbon dioxide. The limestone acts as a flux to remove other impurities and help the iron physically separate from the

## 5.4 describe and explain the main reactions involved in 
 · Iron is displaced from its ore (haematite) by carbon (from coke): 2Fe2O3 + 3C → 4Fe + 3CO2. Also displaced by carbon monoxide: Fe 2 O 3 + 3CO → 2Fe + 3CO 2. Iron burns in hot air blast to form CO 2 (exothermic): C + O 2 → CO 2. At high temperatures in the furnaceCO 2 is reduced to CO: CO 2 + C → 2CO. Limestone reacts with impurities to form slag which is tapped off.

 · Channel induction furnaces are commonly used as holding furnaces (furnace for maintaining a molten metal poured from a melting furnace at a proper temperature). Channel furnaces are also used for melting low melting point alloys and iron. For two or three shift operation channel furnaces are more economical than coreless furnaces.
