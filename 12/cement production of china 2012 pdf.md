## Cement Report 
To date most of the emission reductions in the cement sector are caused by drivers other than the EU ETS. The share of emissions from the cement sector in total EU ETS emissions decreased from 7% in 2008 to 5.6% in 2012 but this was largely due to a decrease of clinker and cement production as a consequence of the state of the economy.

3. Cement grinding The clinker produced is mixed with different ingredients to produce the cement. In the case of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) only around 5% gypsum is added. But so-called 'blended cements' are also widely used in Europe. These cements consist of a mixture of clinker and other products with cementitious properties.

## Estimation of CO2 Emissions from China's Cement Production 
Cement production is a major source of CO 2 emissions in China owing to the large volume produced (CCA 2010 2011; Gregg et al. 2008; PBL 2008; Wang 2008). Generally speaking the CO 2 emissions intensity of hina's cement production is high due to the large amount of outdated inefficient production capacity and the coal-dominated energy mix.

 · In the cement industry however this link is weak. The industry's record of value creation is spotty with ROIC levels roughly equal to the cost of capital at around 9 percent. Behind the lackluster ROIC two drivers stand out: high goodwill (seen in the low tangible capital ratio) and inadequate capital efficiency. Call it bad timing.
