## The fractal crushing of granular materials 
Abstract A study has been made of the micro mechanical origins of the irrecoverable compression of aggregates which comprise brittle grains. The terms "yielding" and "plastic hardening" are used in the discipline of soil mechanics to describe the post-elastic behaviour of granular media. These "plastic" phenomena are here related to the successive splitting of grains.

## Characterization of Granular Material
granular material and an estimation of residual stresses induced by compaction are presented. An analysis of a layered system is included to illus­ trate the effect of residual stresses on the moduli of granular material and to compare the results with values used in existing pavement design procedures.

After crushing the fines produced in the granular materials move into their voids and causes an increase on the bearing capacity of the base. However when the volume of the voids is decreased due to this fines migration the hydraulic conductivity of the crushed material decreases.

## Granular material 
A granular material is a conglomeration of discrete solid macroscopic particles characterized by a loss of energy whenever the particles interact (the most common example would be friction when grains collide). The constituents that compose granular material are large enough such that they are not subject to thermal motion fluctuations. Thus the lower size limit for grains in granular

## On the packing and crushing of granular materials 
This paper is a study of the dependence of the volume of voids in a granular material on the particle size distribution. It has previously been proposed that the volume of voids is proportional to the volume of the smallest particles. In a particle size distribution which is progressively becoming wider (e.g. as occurs due to crushing during the compression of sand) the smallest size of

## On the packing and crushing of granular materials 
 · 1. Introduction. The packing characteristics of granular materials have been studied for over a century. It is generally accepted that the comparative density of any granular material is a function of particle shape size range and size distribution (Burmister 1938) however predictions for the density or porosity for a granular assembly are usually empirical and are only semi-analytical at

 · Unbound compacted granular materials are commonly used in engineering structures as layers in road pavements railroad beds highway embankments and foundations. These structures are generally subjected to dynamic loading by construction operations traffic and wheel loads. These repeated or cyclic loads cause abrasion and crushing of the granular materials.
