## What is Destructive Distillation? (with picture)
Destructive distillation is also used to derive coal tar using a similar process. A number of useful volatiles can be distilled from bituminous coal including pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Coal was also historically distilled into coal gas which was used for purposes such as heating and lighting.
