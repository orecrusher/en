## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron 
 · The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process. The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace. These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.

## How is Iron Refined from Ore? (with pictures)
Although iron does not occur in its pure form in nature some kinds of ore contain up to 70% iron atoms. Iron ore consists of oxygen and iron atoms bonded together into molecules. To create pure iron one must deoxygenate the ore leaving only iron atoms behind which is the essence of the refining process.

 · Iron was smelt from its ores around 1500 BC which created a stronger metal that offered economic and political power and started the Iron Age. In 1722 René Antoine Ferchault the Réaumur wrote a book about the different types of iron and how steel wrought iron and cast iron could be distinguished by the amount of carbon they possessed.
