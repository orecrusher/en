Jayaraman et al. [4] studied the compressive and tensile strength of concrete using lateritic sand and lime stone filler as fine aggregate. The concrete are made using varying contents of lateritic and lime stone filler as fine aggregate. The quantity of laterite is varied from 0% to 100% against lime stone filler at intervals of 25%.
