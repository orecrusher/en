The cement manufacturing process is completed when the cooled clinker is ground once again in a rotating finishing mill. A combination of gypsum and limestone will usually be added in small amounts to the heated cement during this last grinding step and coloring agents can also be added here. The fineness of the finished particles will vary according to individual preferences and the cement

## Cement mill 
By adjusting the fineness of grind the manufacture can produce a range of products from a single clinker. Tight control of fineness is necessary in order to obtain cement with the desired consistent day-to-day performance so round-the-clock measurements are made on the cement as it is produced and mill feed-rates and separator settings are adjusted to maintain constant specific surface.
