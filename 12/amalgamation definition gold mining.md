## Gold 
Most gold mined in Australia today cannot be seen in the rock it is very fine grained and mostly has a concentration of less than 5 grams in every tonne of rock mined. The feasibility of mining low concentrations of gold largely depends on the price of gold. Gold is bought and sold every day on international gold markets.

## Mercury Amalgamation and Fine Gold Recovery 
 · In the 1800's the use of mercury to extract gold from ore (called Amalgamation) was the most commonly used method by small scale prospectors for this purpose. It has been a highly controversial method of extraction to say the least because of both the physical and environmental health risks that mercury poses. Individual prospectors will []

## Silver explained 
 · Silver Mining Stocks: Silver mining stocks can offer indirect exposure to silver prices. These stocks tend to be leveraged plays on silver prices owing to the high fixed costs of extracting the metal. Mining stocks are considerably more liquid than physical silver as they can be bought and sold during market trading hours.

## Mercury Amalgamation 
An increased gold price during the 1980's boosted a new gold mining boom using Hg for amalgamation. This time the boom took place in Latin America Central Africa and South East Asia. An estimated 2 000 t of Hg have been dispersed in the Amazon alone during this latest gold rush which still continues although at reduced scale in the Brazilian Amazon due to exhausted placer deposits.

Many gold mines dump their toxic waste directly into natural water bodies. The Lihir gold mine in Papua New Guinea dumps over 5 million tons of toxic waste into the Pacific Ocean each year destroying corals and other ocean life. Companies mining for gold and other metals in total dump at least 180 million tons of toxic waste into rivers lakes

 · In 1532 the volume of gold provided by Atahualpa the Inka king as ransom for his release from the Spanish was hard evidence for the efficient small-scale mining of placer and hard-rock gold deposits that took place before European contact. Thus far however there has been no research into gold mining technology in the ancient Andes.
