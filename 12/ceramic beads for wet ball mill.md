## Bead Milling 
Bead Mills are machines for dispersion processing where solid particles (pigments fillers) are reduced in size and finely dispersed and wetted out in a liquid phase. Small ceramic glass or metal beads are agitated inside the mill chamber to aid particle size reduction through impact and energy input while the dispersion is pumped through the mill.
