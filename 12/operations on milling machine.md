## Operations On Milling Machine 
Milling and Milling Operations Milling is the process of machining flat curved or irregular surfaces by feeding the workpiece against a rotating cutter containing a number of cutting edges. The milling machine consists basically of a motor driven spindle which mounts and revolves the milling cutter and a reciproing adjustable worktable which mounts and feeds the workpiece.
