 · In practice circulating loads between ball mills and classifiers are rarely less than 200 per cent and frequently exceed 700 per cent. It may appear strange at first sight that the circulating load between a mill and classifier producing for example 100 tons of finished product per day can be as much as 400 tons or more but this will be made clear by Fig. 71.
