## Limestone and Dolomite 
Limestone and dolomite are common building stones and may be crushed into sand gravel and boulders for construction purposes. Limestone is processed into quicklime a component of cement. The rocks are also used to make fluxes soil conditioners abrasives and glass. Desulfinators and neutralizers for cleaning industrial waste are also made

## What Is the Difference Between Limestone Calcite? 
Calcite is a mineral that occurs in the natural geological processes of the Earth. Calcite is a form of calcium carbonate a type of calcium salt oxide with three atoms of oxygen bonded to one atom of calcium. Calcite binds with other compounds to create limestone which is used in construction.

 · For example the main component of limestone is carbonate mineral which is prone to phase transitions under high-temperature conditions (Suito et al. 2001) TGA/DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) analysis shows that calcite decomposes at 700–800 °C and the weight loss of TGA is about 44% due to the escape of carbon dioxide.

## Calcite Limestone And Marble Earth Sciences
Calcite - Rocks and Minerals for Earth Science Fun. Calcite or calcium carbonate is one of the minerals that helps form limestone and marble. Many marine animals use this mineral to construct their shells. Foraminiferons bryozoans brachiopods and oysters all use calcium carbonate to make their shells. Properties of Calcite.

## Calcite 
 · Calcite is typically found in the sedimentary rock called limestone. Calcite is also in marble a metamorphic rock which forms when limestone is put under strong heat and pressure. Calcite crystals have three planes of cleavage. This gives perfect crystals of calcite like in the picture at the left a rhombahedron shape.
