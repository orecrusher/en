## Closed circuit ball mill – Basics revisited 
Based on experience acquired over the years and the investigative work conducted by F.C. Bond it was established that the optimum circulating load for a closed ball mill – cyclone circuit is around 250%. This value is used as guideline for the design of new circuits as well as to assess the performance of existing circuits.

Closed Circuit Ball Mill System Clinker Gypsum and other desired additives are fed to the ball mill in specific proportions based on the quality requirement. Feed material is ground in the ball mill discharged and fed to a classifier with the help of a bucket elevator for classifi ion of the ground cement into two streams – coarse and fines.
