## How steel is made 
To make steel iron ore is first mined from the ground. It is then smelted in blast furnaces where the impurities are removed and carbon is added. In fact a very simple definition of steel is "iron alloyed with carbon usually less than 1%." Blast furnaces require many auxiliary facilities to support their operations.

Blast furnaces are used continuously and are only shut down when their brick lining needs replacing. As the mixture of iron ore coke and limestone heats the hot waste gases are collected and cleansed. They are then used to help heat the air blast required if blast furnace is to reach the high temperatures needed to produce molten iron.

## [Solved] The iron produced in the blast furnace
In a blast furnace coke (C) reacts with oxygen to form carbon monoxide which then reacts with iron oxide to form carbon dioxide and pig iron. Pig iron is obtained by the chemical reduction of iron ore. This process of reduction of the iron ore to pig iron is known as smelting. Hence the iron produced in the blast furnace is pig iron.

In the integrated steelmaking route iron ore containing ferrous oxides is converted to metallic iron inside the blast furnace via a chemical process called 'reduction'. Coal in the form of metallurgical coal and pulverised coal act as the active agents or 'reductants' that strip away oxygen from the iron ore to yield metallic iron.

## Iron Extraction Manufacturing Process 
Iron Extraction Manufacturing Process - Blast Furnace Method. Iron is extracted from different ores exist in the world. Hematite (Fe 2 O 3) is reduced to iron metal in the blast furnace under several steps. Limestone and coke are used as other raw materials to generate heat and reducing agents.

Before iron ore can be used oxygen must be removed from it. Known as 'reducing' this can be done either in the blast furnace where hot air is injected into a continuous feed of coke sinter and lime or by the direct reduced iron (DRI) process. The result from both is liquid iron which is then transported to the basic oxygen furnace.

## How Does a Blast Furnace Work? 
Â Â· The iron ore loaded into the blast furnace is mainly a compound of iron and oxygen. At high temperatures the carbon monoxide produced by the combustion of carbon and carbon in the coke and in the blown extracts the oxygen in the iron ore to obtain iron. This process is called reduction.

## Blast furnace process 
Â Â· A further lowering of the iron ores in the blast furnace leads to the temperature zone of 400 Â°C to 800 Â°C. In this region the so-called indirect reduction of iron ores to iron by carbon monoxide takes place. The carbon monoxide gas (C O) is oxidized to carbon dioxide (C O 2) by absorbing the oxygen contained in the iron oxide (O).
