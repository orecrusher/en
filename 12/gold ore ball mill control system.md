## Grade Control 
Abstract. In some mining operations one of the most important roles played by the geologist is the supervision of grade control. In an open-pit operation this involves the sampling of blast-hole cuttings produced by down-the-hole hammer drills and the classifiion of bench reserves into ore low grade or waste material or into various metallurgical types.

## MILLING CONTROL OPTIMISATION
MILL FEED CONTROL. Smooth operation of a milling circuit is difficult to achieve due to: • The varying nature of the feed material (size ore hardness etc.). • The unfavorable dynamics between feeders and the weightometer. These dynamics degrade the performance of PID controllers making feed optimisation more challenging.

## Ball Mill 
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

The long residence time of the gold within the grinding circuit can cause some of the GRG to become non-gravity recoverable due to smearing on to grinding media mill liners and gangue minerals. This effect is minor as more than 98% of the GRG entering the ball mill remains gravity recoverable after grinding (LaPlante 2000).
