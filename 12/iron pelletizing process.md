## PELLETIZING TECHNOLOGY 
Circular Pelletizing Plant The building footprint of the induration furnace is significantly smaller compared with the straight grate process which means that the world's most compact pelletizing plant - with its low building profile short process air ducts and standardized equipment - allows the cost of iron production to be slashed.

## iron ore pelletizing versus concentrate
The iron pelletizing process is often associated with low grade iron ore following a range of liberation techniques to prepare and make suitable for the blast furnace. In summary pelletizing is achieved by combining the iron ore with water and a specific binder which is then rolled up in drum to produce relatively uniform pellets which can then be easily handled in downstream processes.

The pelletizing process is a process which contains numerous sub-processes or process segments. On the way from the mine to a final product the iron ore goes through the following main process segments: 1) The iron ore is crushed and the waste rock is removed. About 85 % of the particles should be less than 44 μm (in length width or height).
