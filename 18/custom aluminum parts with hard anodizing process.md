## Aluminum Anodizing 
 · In all anodizing processes the basic reaction is conversion of the aluminum surface to aluminum oxide. The aluminum part when made anodic in an electrolytic cell causes the oxide layer to become thicker leading to better corrosion and wear resistance. For decorative purposes the oxide layer formed on the surface can be dyed.
