## Study on Compressive Strength of Quarry Dust as Fine 
 · Strength of the concrete is mainly dependent on bonding of the fine aggregates which fills the voids between the coarse aggregates. It is found that the strength of concrete is more for w/c of 0.45 when compared with w/c of 0.5. As the quantity of water increases the compressive strength decreases when replaced with quarry dust.

In contrast concrete varies in density and is about 150 lb/cu ft to offer relatively higher comprehensive strength than aerated concrete. Besides low strength concrete includes 14MPa (2000psi) while concrete for routine use includes 20Mpa (2900psi). Typical high-strength concrete blocks have a strength of 40Mpa (5800psi) to 410Mpa (5900psi).
