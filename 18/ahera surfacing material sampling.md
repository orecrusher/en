• The sampling tool was cleaned with a damp disposable towel. The sample area was wet-wiped of any fallen debris. The sampling protocol established by AHERA was used to determine the required number of samples for this survey based on function (surfacing thermal system insulation or miscellaneous materials) and homogeneous areas.

 · Sampling procedures cover the practice of selecting representative quantities of test material in the field to evaluate bulk materials. Examples of the test materials are bulk granular solids slurries sludges grains and solid fuels. It is necessary to be able to sample bulk materials during shipment and during processing operations.
