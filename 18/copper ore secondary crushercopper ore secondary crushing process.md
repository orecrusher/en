## Copper extraction 
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source local environmental regulations and other factors.. As in all mining operations the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## Innovations: How Do They Do That? How Copper is Made
Copper ore in concentrations ranging from 0.29 percent to ten times that amount is mined from open pit or underground mines. The crushed mine ore is ground in rod and ball mills and then sent to flotation machines where the copper mineral rises to the top in a froth making a copper concentrate of approximately 30 percent 27 percent iron and 33 percent sulfur.

The ore is then ground finely before the copper-bearing sulfide minerals are concentrated by a flotation process which separates the grains of ore mineral from the waste material or gangue. Depending on the type of copper bearing minerals in the ore and the treatment processes used the concentrate typically contains between 25 and 30% copper however may be as high as approximately 60% copper.
