The pores of a filter are measured in microns. "Micron" is another term for the micrometer or one-millionth of a meter (0.000039"). Probably the easiest thing to use as a frame of reference at this tiny scale would be a human hair: one strand is typically around 90 microns wide. The lower the micron rating the smaller the filter's openings.

Micro filtration. Membranes with a pore size of 0.1 – 10 µm perform micro filtration. Microfiltration membranes remove all bacteria. Only part of the viral contamination is caught up in the process even though viruses are smaller than the pores of a micro filtration membrane. This is because viruses can attach themselves to bacterial biofilm.

Slow sand filtration relies on both physical and biological activity in controlling plant pathogens. In a slow sand filter the filter bed is constructed of a medium with high surface area which can be colonized by suppressive micro-organisms. This fine media also presents a physical barrier to the passage of spores of plant pathogens.

 · You can use any type of sand you want but avoid using colored craft sand. Colored sand may leak dyes into the water. Try to make the sand layer about as thick as the charcoal layer. The bottle should be a little more than half-way full by now. Try using two types of sand: a fine grained sand and a coarse grained sand.
