## Milling Machine: Parts Types Operations Milling Cutter 
 · Milling is the machining process in which the removal of metal takes place due to the cutting action of a rotating milling cutter.In a milling machine the cutter is rotating due to workpiece is fed against it.This machine can hold more than one tool at a time. The cutter rotates at high speed and because of the many cutting edges it removes metal at a very fast rate.
