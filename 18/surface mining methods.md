## Digging deeper: Mining methods explained 
Open-pit is one of the most common mining methods used and starts from the earth's surface maintaining exposure to the surface throughout the extraction period. The excavation usually has stepped sides to ensure the safety of the miners and a wide ramp where equipment can travel allowing the product to be removed efficiently from the site.

## Types of Mining Methods 
 · Compared to other mining methods room-and-pillar mining is a low-cost method with a low recovery rate (since some ore is left behind in pillars). Open pit mining method works best when the deposit is close to the surface as it is way more economical to use this method instead of underground mining.

## Surface Mining Techniques used in the Oil Sands 
 · Oil sands mining operations are some of the largest mines in the world. Although open-pit oil sands mines have a lot in common with traditional hard-rock mines (such as gold or copper) oil sands operators have some unique challenges due to the softness of the deposit. Learn more about surface mining techniques used in the oil sands.

## Mining 
Mining techniques can be divided into two common excavation types: surface mining and sub-surface (underground) mining. Today surface mining is much more common and produces for example 85% of minerals (excluding petroleum and natural gas) in the United States including 98% of metallic ores.

## Surface mining – strip open pit mountaintop removal 
Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed. It is the other way of underground mining in which the overlying rock is left behind and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.. Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface

While surface mining is used for coal that can be found anywhere from the surface to 200 feet below underground mining is used for coal that is loed lower. In surface mining the top layer is removed which may include plants soil rocks. This exposes the coal below the top layer.

## Equipment Selection for Surface Mining: A Review
A surface mine contains pits with mineral endowed rock (or ore). We extract ore that lies within the upper layer of the earth from surface mines (Fricke 2006)This ore can include metals such as iron copper coal and gold. There are several methods of surface mining including open-pit stripping dredging and mountain-top removal.

Surface mining methods. Surface mining methods Auger mining recovers coal through the use of a large-diameter drill driven into a coalbed in the side of a surface mine pit. It usually follows contour surface mining particularly when the overburden is too costly to excavate.

## Mining Methods Now and in the Future 
 · But mining still starts with extracting mineral resources from the earth. Here we'll examine traditional and novel mining techniques. The American Geosciences web site defines four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.

The vocabulary of underground mining has developed over several centuries. Underground mines are excavated using a variety of methods.

4.3.1: Surface Mining Methods. Surface mining methods are traditionally divided into two classes: mechanical and aqueous.Mechanical methods rely on breaking the ore by mechanical means and aqueous methods rely on the use of water or another solvent e.g. an acid to break down the ore and facilitate its removal.

Is a type of mining in which soil and rock overlying the mineral deposit (the overburden) are removed. Surface mining is the predominant exploitation method worldwide. Surface mining requires large capital investment (primarily expensive transportation equipment) but generally results in: High productivity (i.e. high output rate of ore)

## Surface Mining 
Surface mining which originated in the mid-16th century is a type of mining that removes the soil and rock which cover mineral deposits or coal seams. As suggested by its name this technique is used to mine minerals and ores found closer to the surface or those which are too heavy to handle.

## Surface Mining Techniques 
Surface mining is a broad term that includes techniques used to extract minerals near the Earth's surface. One technique is strip mining where the overburden is removed using dozers draglines or scrapers depending on the terrain.

## Types of Mining Methods 
Surface mining. Surface mining is best suited to extract minerals that are close to the surface of the earth. It is also usually a more cost-effective mining method compared to underground mining. Common minerals extracted using surface mining are some of the most mined including coal iron and bauxite. Underground mining (or subsurface mining)

## Focus on Surface Mining Methods 
 · The three most frequent surface mining methods are generally strip mining terrace exploration and open pit exploration. Strip mining is if at all possible applied where the surface of the terrain and the ore body itself are generally relatively horizontal and not way too deep under the surface and a wide area is available to be mined in a series of whitening strips.

 · Most mining operations combine different methods to extract minerals most efficiently. Initially the mineral closer to the surface would be mined using a surface mining method. After the minerals have been exhausted that way the coal found deeper in the seam would be mined using an underground mining method.

## The Four Main Methods of Mining 
 · Surface mining; Surface mining is a method of mining that involves removing the soil and the overlying rock on top of the mineral deposit. This method of mining gained popularity since the start of the 20th century especially in North America where the majority of surface mining occurs.

## What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Surface Mining?
 · Surface mining also called strip mining delivers economically vital supplies of coal which powers transportation and creates consumer products boosting local economies. This type of mining occurs primarily on mountaintops and dates back to the early 20th century when new machines made moving earth easier.

## What is Strip Mining? Methods and Impact 
 · The Strip Mining Method. All surface or strip mining initially eradies the vegetation rock sediment and soil spread over the surface to uncover and remove coal from an underground mineral seam or coal deposit. I should also mention phosphate mining operations are very similar to coal mining operations.
