Palladium. Palladium together with rhodium ruthenium osmium iridium and platinum form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (PGM).Palladium is a lustrous silver-white metal. It has a face-centered cubic crystalline structure at ordinary temperatures it is strongly resistant to corrosion in air and to the action of acids.

For the separation of gold platinum(IV) and palladium and for the isolation of gold from other metals the reversed-phase partition chromatography has been used as a column process in which TBP is adsorbed on Daiflon(polytrifluorochloroethylene moulding powder) as the stationary phase and hydrochloric acid as the mobile phase.

## How to Make Money Recycling Palladium — Reclaim Recycle 
 · Palladium is one of the more valuable precious metals currently trading at $819 on the London Fix – compared to $924 for platinum and $1250 for gold. Although it is rare in nature palladium is not too difficult to find in many recyclable items including automotive and industrial alytic converters and in alloys of gold and other metals.

## Inquartation and Parting Refining Process 
If any palladium is present in the original material as might be the case for white gold scrap palladium will dissolve in aqua regia but will remain in solution when the gold is precipitated and can be recovered separately. The refining process is illustrated schematically in Figure 1.

## Refining of Palladium and making its salt
 · Your Platinum and palladium salts should be heated to 800 °C to make the sponge (separately of course). To produce the Platinum and palladium metals from the sponge will require heating to 1800 °C. The metals produced are .999 pure and can be poured into graphite moulds to produce coins or bars your choice.

The silver based bullion is suspended in concentrated acid to slowly leach the silver platinum and palladium into solution and separate out any gold which is sent for further refining. The iron based bullion is also acid leached but follows a different chemical treatment route given the different solubilities of the five pgms that it contains.
