## Iron Ore 
Iron Ore. Iron (Fe) is a metallic element which constitutes about 5% of the Earth's crust and is the fourth most abundant element in the crust. Iron ores are rocks from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The principal iron ores are hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ). Almost all iron ore is used in blast furnaces to

## The Six Main Steps of Iron Ore Processing 
 · This step involves breaking up the iron ore to obtain an F 80 grind size before it can be ground. Once the ore has been crushed it is diverted to a stockpile. The aim of this step is to ensure a smooth crushing process and minimize downtime in the event of a breakdown or to allow planned maintenance in the crushing system without stopping the grinding and other further steps.

The rock is mixed with water and ground in rotating mills until it is as fine as powder. Separation The iron ore is separated from the taconite using magnetism.
