## Reducing the carbon intensity of the iron making value 
"It's difficult for us to influence what goes on there and the energy used is significantly higher in the smelting process than it is in the mining process." The main source of carbon emissions comes from the use of metallurgical coal as fuel or coke to melt the waste material – also known as gangue – from the ore to extract the iron.

## Chapter 4: Mining waste 
Iron ores generally have higher grades than sulfide or gold ores often going over 50 per cent or more. Less tailings are therefore generally produced in iron ore projects. In gold and silver mines ore grades are generally in the range of grams per tonne.

## What Is Involved in the Processing of Iron Ore? (with 
The main goal for the processing of iron ore is to take the ore extracted during the mining effort break the ore into usable units and then purify those units before the actual smelting begins. Doing so makes it easier to produce a higher grade of iron that in turn can be used to create materials for use in everything from manufacturing lawn furniture to cookware to building materials.
