 · Material efficiency for basalt fiber is enhanced by the fact that no secondary materials are needed to create the fiber or as Gencarelle puts it "One pound of rock becomes one pound of fiber.". The melt point for basalt of 1500 ° C is also comparable to glass for which the melt point ranges from 1400 to 1600 ° C.
