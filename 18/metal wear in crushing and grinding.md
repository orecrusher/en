## Machining 101 — What is Grinding? 
 · Precision grinding is a middle-ground between metal removal and part size control and serves as the basis for creep feed grinding slot grinding and high-efficiency deep grinding. In ultra-precision grinding little to no actual cutting occurs but sliding action from very fine grains rubs the workpiece surface to a high finish.
