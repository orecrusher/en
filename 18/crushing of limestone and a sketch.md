## Statistical study of the crushing of limestone grains 
 · The behavior of granular materials subjected to shear loading is often very complex to be correctly characterized. Loads on a discrete medium composed by several grains lead to a diffusion of stresses in the medium by contact and frictions between individual grains. This stress diffusion combined to inter-granular relative movements induces some cracking in the contact zones and even some
