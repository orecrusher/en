## What is Lightweight Concrete? 
Aerated concrete is a lightweight cellular material consisting of cement and/or lime and sand or other silicious material. It is made by either a physical or a chemical process during which either air or gas is introduced into a slurry which generally contains no coarse material. Aerated concrete used as a structural material is usually high
