## Method of Gold Separation
Method of Gold Separation--1. Gravity Separation. The gravity separation working principle: Separate minerals according to the different relative density of the mineral (usually called specific gravity). The mineral particles of different density are treated by moving medium (water air and heavy liquid) with the hydrodynamic and mechanical forces.
