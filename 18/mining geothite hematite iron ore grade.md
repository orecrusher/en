## Iron ore 
Increasing iron ore demand coupled with the depletion of high-grade hematite ores in the United States after World War II led to development of lower-grade iron ore sources principally the utilization of magnetite and taconite. Iron ore mining methods vary by the type of ore being mined.

Among the four types of iron ore deposits found in this area are magnetite and hematite ore. In Minnesota magnetite iron ore is mined mainly in the Mesabi iron range one of the four ranges that make up the Iron Range of Minnesota.

 · Flotation tests conducted on the two Iron Duke samples using oleate showed that the presence of goethite adversely affected the flotation response of the hematite but contact angle measurements showed a higher hydrophobicity for the sample containing 25% goethite. Correcting the oleate addition for the changes in surface area still showed that the goethite reduced the flotability of the hematite.
