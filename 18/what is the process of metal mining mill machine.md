 · The conventional process of milling stamping and otherwise processing large sheets of metal causes extensive waste of material. In contrast 3-D printers melt only the powder or wire required to build the component's skeleton and structure layer by layer. Manufacturers can then remove any excess powder from the printer and reuse it.
