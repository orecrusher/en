## High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis
The impact energy of the milling balls in the normal direction attains a value of up to 40 times higher than that due to gravitational acceleration. Hence the planetary ball mill can be used for high-speed milling. Schematic view of motion of the ball and powder mixture.
