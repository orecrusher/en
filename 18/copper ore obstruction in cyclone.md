## Copper extraction 
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source local environmental regulations and other factors.. As in all mining operations the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

## Copper Mining and Extraction: Oxide Ores
Copper is refined from ores in the ground either through underground or open-pit mines. Most of the copper ores mined today are oxide or sulfide ores. Extraction of sulfide ores is covered in more detail in Copper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide Ores (11–14) but is introduced here because an important by-product of this process is used for the extraction of oxide ores.

## Hydrocyclone Working Principle
 · The entrance to the cyclone was designed this way to allow the incoming feed to help generate and not interfere with the spiral path that the ore must take inside the cyclone. The centrifugal force ( the central Hydrocyclone Working Principle ) that is generated by this spin forces the "bigger particles outwards towards the wall of the cyclone.
