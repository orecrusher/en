## Refining Silicon 
The silica is reduced (oxygen removed) through a reaction with carbon in the form of coal charcoal and heating to °C in an electrode arc furnace. SiO 2 + C → Si + CO 2. The resulting silicon is metallurgical grade silicon (MG-Si). It is 98% pure and is used extensively in the metallurgical industry.
