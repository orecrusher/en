The gyroscope precesses around a vertical axis since the torque is always horizontal and perpendicular to L. If the gyroscope is not spinning it acquires angular momentum in the direction of the torque ( L = ΔL ) and it rotates around a horizontal axis falling over just as we would expect. Earth itself acts like a gigantic gyroscope.
