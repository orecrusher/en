## Energy efficiency • Energy intensity in copper and gold mining
Mines are faced with numerous challenges such as falling raw material prices declining metal grades in the ores and higher energy prices. Especially because ore processing is particularly energy-intensive the industry is again focusing on the saving of energy. This report shows what are the key energy saving considerations in the copper and gold mining sectors.
