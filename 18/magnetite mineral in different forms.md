Magnetite is one of the most resistant common minerals in basalt and forms the bulk of heavy mineral sands. Other minerals disintegrate and release their components to water as ions or form clay minerals. Iron and aluminum are among the least mobile ions and therefore tend to form laterite deposits enriched in these elements.

Magnetite minerals are reddish-black to brownish-black opaque with a metallic to submetallic luster. Magnetite and magnesioferrite are strongly magnetic and were common components of lodestone. Most minerals of the magnetite series show octahedral crystal growth habit with square or triangular sections but they may also exist as anhedral granular forms.

 · Magnetite. Magnetite is a natural magnet! Part of a mineral group called the oxides magnetite can usually be identified by its strong magnetism and dark color. Magnetite is often not very abundant but it can be found in many different types of igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. It can even be found in some meteorites.

## A Description of Magnetite 
Magnetite. Magnetite is strongly magnetic. It was used by the ancient Chinese to make the first magnetic compasses. The chemical formula is Fe 3 O 4 commonly called ferrous-ferric oxide and is valuable as an iron ore. Magnetite reacts with oxygen to produce hematite another iron ore. In crystalline form magnetite is usually octahedral.

Metamorphic grade is important not just because different kinds of rocks and minerals form at different temperatures but because temperature affects chemical reaction rates. Rocks metamorphosed at low temperature may change only very slowly and some changes may not go to completion.
