## What Aluminum Extraction Really Does to the Environment 
 · Through electrolysis (the introduction of a very intense electrical current) the liquefied aluminum can then be successfully extracted cleaned and poured into solid ingots. Approximately 1 ton of aluminum oxide is produced from every 4 tons of mined bauxite. Products made with aluminum

## Aluminium smelting 
Aluminium smelting is the process of extracting aluminium from its oxide alumina generally by the Hall-Héroult process.Alumina is extracted from the ore bauxite by means of the Bayer process at an alumina refinery.. This is an electrolytic process so an aluminium smelter uses huge amounts of electric power; smelters tend to be loed close to large power stations often hydro-electric
