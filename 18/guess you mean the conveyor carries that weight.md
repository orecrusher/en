The modulus of elasticity is calculated by dividing the stress by the strain whereM = modulus of elasticity (ISO 9856) F = force (N) ε elast = elastic elongation at the end of the specified number of cycles (N/mm). In other words: The higher the modulus the lower the elastic elongation per unit stress.
