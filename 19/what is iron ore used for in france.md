## Pig Iron 
Pig iron is the product of smelting iron ore (also ilmenite) with a high-carbon fuel and reductant such as coke usually with limestone as a flux. Charcoal and anthracite are also used as fuel and reductant. Pig iron is produced by smelting or iron ore in blast furnaces or by smelting ilmenite in electric furnaces .
