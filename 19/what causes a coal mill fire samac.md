## Coal
A coal-seam fire is a burning of an outcrop or underground coal seam.Most coal-seam fires exhibit smoldering combustion particularly underground coal-seam fires because of limited atmospheric oxygen availability. Coal-seam fire instances on Earth date back several million years. Due to thermal insulation and the avoidance of rain/snow extinguishment by the crust underground coal-seam fires

Pulverizer housing or burner lines are glowing red. Mill fires require immediate attention to prevent damage to the pulverizer and more damaging mill "puffs". Explosions in a pulverized coal system are normally called "puffs.". A mill puff is an explosion in the mill system caused by an explosive combination of coal air and temperature.
