 · Underground mining operations are in many cases provided with a substantial surge capacity between the mine and the primary crushing plant. Furthermore in medium and large operations of this character the primary crusher is almost invariably large enough to meet the required output so that the mined ore causes little or no trouble due to bridging or blocking.
