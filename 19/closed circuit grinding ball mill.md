## What is a closed circuit dry grinding ball mills? 
 · In a closed mill circuit the oversize particles are returned from the post milling processes to be remilled whereas with an open circuit the process has no feedback loop. In dry grinding systems the material from conventional crushing and screening operations is subject to coarse and fine grinding primarily in roller mills or ball mills to reduce the material to the necessary product size range.

Working Principle of Ball mill: As the mill rotates steel balls work to grind the materials. The mill rotates approximately once every couple of seconds. The grinding system uses either 'open circuit' or 'closed circuit'. In an open circuit system the feed rate of materials is adjusted to achieve the desired fineness of the product.
