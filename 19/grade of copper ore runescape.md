## How to Calculate Grade and Recovery with Examples 
 · The ore grade refers to the fraction of a useful element within the ore. It can also be used for gangue as the proportion of a non-valuable substance but generally when we use the term grade we mean the grade of a valuable element. For example a copper ore grade of 1% means that in 100 tons of the ore we have 1 ton of copper.

As you can see in the example above the deposit does not have to be enormous in size (only 500 meters long by 100 meters wide) to contain a valuable deposit (approximately $6 billion worth of minerals). However in order to be as realistic as possible about this valuation you can not assume that the complete ore body contains the same grade (i.e. 2% copper and 1.5 gram per tonne gold).
