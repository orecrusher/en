Efficient infra-red stimulable fluoride phosphors can be prepared using 5 or 6 nines pure materials and conventional flux growth equipment. BeF 2 additions act as flux encapsulant and getter for oxygen; permitting the development of well crystallized grains of the rare earth fluoride. As a result improved Er and Ho green and Tm blue efficiencies have been realized.

 · Phosphor is initially irradiated by x-rays for 1000 s to fill ambient stimulable traps. Subsequently phosphor is stimulated by AT (300 K in darkness) and AL (650 lux at 77 K) respectively. To empty half the traps of the phosphor corresponding stimulation times are experimentally determined as t AT = 520 s and t AL = 980 s respectively.

## Photostimulated luminescence 
Photostimulated luminescence (PSL) is the release of stored energy within a phosphor by stimulation with visible light to produce a luminescent signal. X-rays may induce such an energy storage. A plate based on this mechanism is called a photostimulable phosphor (PSP) plate and is one type of X-ray detector used in projectional radiography.
