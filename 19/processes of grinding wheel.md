The grinding wheels are cut out of the rolled sheet to a specified diameter and hole size. Scraps are kneaded rolled and cut out again. Then the wheels are vulcanized in molds under pressure in ovens at approximately 150 to 175°C (300 to 350°F). The finishing and inspection processes are similar to those for other types of wheels.

 · In the late 1970's Continuous-Dress Creep-Feed grinding (CDCF) came onto the scene. Instead of dressing between parts or passes the grinding wheel is constantly dressed while it's machining. Not only is the grinding wheel held continuously in a constant state of maximum sharpness but the form is accurately maintained.

When the sharpness of grinding wheel becomes dull because of glazing and loading dulled grains and chips are removed (crushed or fallen) with a proper dressing tool to make sharp cutting edges. A dressing is the conditioning of the wheel surface which ensures that grit cutting edges are exposed from the bond and thus able to penetrate the workpiece material.
