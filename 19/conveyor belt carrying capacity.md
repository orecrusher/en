## How to Increase Conveyor Capacity 
When the belt was replaced with a belt with non LRR pulley cover rubber the conveyor motors could only support 7000 mt/h capacity. However in the case of the ST10000 where high elevation change is involved the rolling resistance benefit is significantly reduced as the energy required to lift the material becomes dominant.

## Carrying Capacity Of Belt Conveyor Belt Conveyor
Conveyor Belt Equations / The pitch of idlers is determined by the idler load rating or the carrying capacity of each idler on the sag of the belt between the idlers belt tension and belt speed. Ideally the pace between the successive idlers should be approximately equal to the width of the belt (spacing should not exceed 1.2 m).
