## New Tests Can Detect Tiny but Toxic Particles of Coal Ash 
 · Fly ash is part of coal combustion residuals (CCRs) that are generated when a power plant burns pulverized coal. The tiny fly ash particles which are often microscopic in size contain high concentrations of arsenic selenium and other toxic elements many of which have been enriched through the combustion process.
