## How Is Marble Formed From Limestone? 
 · Marble is formed from limestone when the limestone is affected by heat and high pressure during a process known as metamorphism. During metamorphism the calcite limestone recrystallizes forming the interlocking calcite crystals that make up the marble. Metamorphism occurs in limestone when the limestone is loed to convergent plate
