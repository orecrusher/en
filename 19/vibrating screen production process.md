## Processes 
Screening techniques have been widely deployed in industrial production for the size-separation of granular materials such as coal. The elliptical vibrating screen has been regarded as an excellent screening apparatus in terms of its high screening efficiency and large processing capacity. However its fundamental mechanisms and operational principles remain poorly understood.
