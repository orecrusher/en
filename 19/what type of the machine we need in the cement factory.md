## Factory Method Design Pattern 
Factory Method Pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create. It promotes the loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind appliion-specific classes into the code. That means the code interacts solely with the resultant interface or abstract class so that it will work with any classes that implement that interface or that extends that abstract class.
