## Understanding the Different Types of Crushers 
Cone and gyratory crushers. Cone crushers and gyratory crushers are also compression-type machines that crush material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece. The output is controlled by the setting between the two pieces of steel. Though the chamber is round in shape the moving piece of steel is not meant to rotate.

## Cone Crushers 
Cone Crushers. A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel. Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point.

It is known and also predicted by the model that the cone crusher's total throughput depends on the Eccentric Speed and exhibits a quasi-concave response with respect to this variable.On-line optimization of the throughput is suggested to be based on the concept of Extremum Seeking Control (ESC).Two dierent methods of ESC were applied.
