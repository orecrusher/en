##  Copper Ore Beneficiation Process Introduction 
 · This beneficiation of copper ore method has been applied in the production practice but not so common. Acid leaching process. It refers to the using of dilute sulfuric acid leaching acidic leaching agent for oxide copper ore beneficiation process. Acid leaching can be divided into percolation leaching and agitation leaching. Percolation

## A review of the beneficiation of copper
 · Sulphidisation followed by flotation is the preferred beneficiation technique for oxidised copper-cobalt ores. • The integration of CPS systems into the flotation circuits can help minimise reagent overconsumption. • Appliion of selective flotation can help a concentrator to produce separate oxide and sulphide concentrates.
