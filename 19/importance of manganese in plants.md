## A General Overview On Manganese (Mn) Importance For Crops 
Manganese (Mn) plays an important role in oxidation and reduction processes in plants such as the electron transport in photosynthesis. Manganese also has played a role in chlorophyll production and its presence is essential in Photosystem II. Manganese acts as an activating factor which is causes the activation more than 35 different enzymes.
