Despite this early production most copper used in the United States was imported from Chile until 1844 when mining of large deposits of high-grade copper ore around Lake Superior began. The development of more efficient processing techniques in the late-1800s allowed the mining of lower-grade copper ores from huge open-pit mines in the western United States.

copper mining: surface and underground mining. Due to copper being spread in relatively low concentrations over large areas surface or open-pit mining is the predominant mining method for copper in the world. After mining copper is produced by one of two process routes: pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical.
