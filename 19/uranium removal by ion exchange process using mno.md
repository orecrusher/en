Two process options that were investigated involved the use of MnO 2 and SO 2 /air as the oxidant. These studies showed that the costs associated with the purchase and transport of chemical reagents is high and the use of the potentially cheaper SO 2 /air system creates technical challenges in the subsequent ion exchange process used to recover the uranium.

The ion exchange treatment process uses special resins to remove charged inorganic contaminants like arsenic chromium nitrate calcium radium uranium and excess fluoride from water. When source water is passed through a series of resin beads it exchanges its charged contaminants for the harmless charged ions stored on the resin surface.
