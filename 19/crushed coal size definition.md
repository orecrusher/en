## ASTM D4749 / D4749M 
4.1 This test method concerns the sieving of coal into designated size fractions for the purpose of characterizing the material as to its particle size distribution for further processing or for commercial purposes. This is covered in Part A of this standard. Raw as well as prepared (crushed cleaned or screened) coals can be tested by this test method.
