## Coagulants and Flocculants for Wastewater Treatment 
Coagulants and Flocculants Coagulants and flocculant's are formulated to assist in the solids/liquid separation of suspended particles in solution. Such particles are characteristically very small and the suspended stability of such particles (colloidal complex) is due to both their small size and to the electrical charge between particles.

## Thickener Operating pH and Lime for Flocculation 
 · The pH scale is used to determine how acidic or basic the water is. Most flocculants work best at neutral conditions (pH 7) while some work independently of the pH. Flocculants are egorized as anionic nonionic or ionic and therefore affected by pulp pH. Basic thickener operation will have you understand the simple electrics of water.

## Flocculant 
The organic flocculants are more expensive on a unit-weight basis than the inorganic flocculants in general use but the required dosage is much lower. The organic flocculant for OMWW must have ionic properties on account of the charge on the surface of the colloid particles; it must also have non-toxic and non-polluting properties to be used later as inter alia feed for animals or fertilizers.

## Coagulants and flocculants fact sheet
Flocculation is a process of contact and adhesion whereby dispersed particles form larger-size clusters. Flocculation can occur through the use of a coagulant flocculant or both. Coagulants achieve flocculation through charge neutralisation whereas flocculants physically bind clay and colloidal particles together.
