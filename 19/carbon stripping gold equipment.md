Activated Carbon Stripping Gold RefiningMay 27 2010· The gold is often recovered by burning. Other schemes involve first mechanically separating the gold metal from the carbon by abrasion or by such things as ultrasonics. The gold is then recovered by gravity methods. The following attachments give all of this in more detail.
