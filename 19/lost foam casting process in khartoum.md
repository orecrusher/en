## Lost foam casting process 
 · Lost foam casting is a method of producing complex metal pieces and sections in which molten metal evaporates into a foam mold that is kept still by sand. The process begins with a polystyrene foam mold which can be cut machined from a foam block or produced from an injection molding process.

The lost foam casting process originated in 1958 but due to strong patents that covered the process early development was restricted. Only when the patent expired around 1980 was free development possible and during the 1990s much work was done and the lost foam casting process is now a technical and commercial success.

The Lost Foam Casting Process (LFCP) which employs expanded foam patterns placed in unbonded sand is increasingly gaining popularity in the foundry industry. The time and cost associated with introducing new Lost Foam (LF) castings into production could be significantly reduced by using simulation codes capable of modeling metal fill and solidifiion and predicting defect formation.

Lost-foam casting (LFC) is a casting method used to create solid metal parts from molten metal. The cost of production of these castings by the LFC process is much less relative to the conventional processes such as sand casting. Over the past 20 — 25 years almost 30% of the die cast components have come to be produced by the LFC process.
