Tailings are discharged – normally as slurry – to a storage facility where water is subsequently recovered and recycled back into the operation. Tailings are mainly discharged in two ways. The first is to use below water approaches. The second is to use above water/above ground approaches.

Our thickened tailings solution uses a high-rate or high-density thickener resulting in 50 to 65% solids to recover water in tailings prior to disposal. With this option you will recover higher volumes of water and reduce losses to seepage and evaporation. Advantages. Higher water reclamation for re-use.
