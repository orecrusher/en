 · Aggregates are classified into fine and coarse aggregates. Fine aggregates generally consist of natural sand or crushed stone with most particles smaller than 4.76 mm .Coarse aggregates that are used in general construction consist of one or a combination of particles generally having size between 4.76mm and 20mm.

## Quantified sustainability of recycled concrete aggregates 
 · The conservation of coarse aggregates has been largely ignored in the USA even though they account for about half of a concrete mix by volume. The production of natural crushed stone sand and gravel in the USA accounts for over half of all mining and associated processing and transport operations use energy and adversely affect ecology.
