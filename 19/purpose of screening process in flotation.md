The float data type is inherited from Java; you can read more about the technical details here and here. Processing supports the double datatype from Java as well. However none of the Processing functions

## Flotation Froth 
Froth flotation is a process that selectively separates materials based upon whether they are water repelling (hydrophobic) or have an affinity for water (hydrophilic). Importantly the word flotation is also used in the literature to describe the process in density separation in which lighter microplastics float to the surface of a salt solution.
