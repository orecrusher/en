## Basics of a Hydrocyclone 
Basics of a Hydrocyclone. Hydrocyclones (also referred to as cyclones) are an efficient way to separate slurries. With no moving parts they depend on the feed pressure or velocity into the cyclone to generate a centripetal force. This centripetal force allows the cyclone to separate coarse or dense particles from fine particles.

 · The hydrocyclone is oriented so that the wide opening is at the top and the narrow opening at the bottom. The product stream enters the vessel at an angle such that the flow path creates a circular pattern around the inside of the hydrocyclone. The narrowing shape of the cyclone causes the water to swirl around the cyclone at high speed.

For many years hydrocyclones commonly referred to as cyclones have been extensively utilized in the classifiion of particles in comminution circuits. The practical range of classifiion for cyclones is 40 microns to 400 microns with some remote appliions as fine as 5 microns or as coarse as 1000 microns. Cyclones are used in both primary and secondary grinding circuits as well as

 · The water line from the FWKO vessel feeds to a hydrocyclone unit and then onto a gas flotation system before discharging overboard. Thus the hydrocyclones are operating at low pressure compared to North Sea practices. The water line from the cyclones flows to a flotation unit and then is discharged overboard (see Figure 6).
