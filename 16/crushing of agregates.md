## Aggregate crushing value test 
It is recommended that the crushing value of aggregate should be less than 30%. If it is more than 30 % then 10% finer aggregate is suggested to use. The aggregate whose crushing value is less than 30% can be used for cement concrete road. The aggregate whose crushing value is less than 40% can be used for wearing surface.

Then crushed aggregates are then sieved through 2.36 mm sieve and weight of passing material is expressed as percentage of the weight of the total sample which is the aggregate crushing value. A value less than 10 signifies an exceptionally strong aggregate while above 35 would normally be regarded as weak aggregates.
