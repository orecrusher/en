## Sand filtration 
Sand filtration is a process in which the treatment of the water is realised by the 'porous' nature of a sand layer which traps particles present in water. Various other physical/ biological processes also take place in a sand filter which further strip the water of different substances (deferrisation demanganisation ammonium removal).
