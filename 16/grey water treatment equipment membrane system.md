Treatment systems may be ideal for some appliions especially where large volumes of greywater are produced daily and the gardens are big enough to utilise the water. However it may be simpler and cheaper to use a rainwater tank for laundry water supply combined with a simple diversion-and-filter system for laundry and bathroom greywater reuse.
