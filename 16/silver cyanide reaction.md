## Reactions of the cyanide ion with the packed
Abstract Current-potential curves are given for flow of solution containing cyanideion through a silver packed-bed electrode. It is shown that under the proper experimental conditions analyses of the free cyanide ion may be carried out. It is also shown that within certain concentration limits analyses of mixtures of CN − and Cl − may be carried out.

Normally the alkylation of an alkali metal cyanide gives a nitrile but the silver ion protects the carbon end of the cyanide. Commonly isocyanides are synthesized by the reaction of primary amines with dichlorocarbene or by dehydration of a formamide with phosphorus oxychloride. RNH 2 + CCl 2 + 2 NaOH → RNC + 2 NaCl + 2 H 2 O

That's the difference between the reaction with silver cyanide and alkalic metal cyanide. The latter is easily dissociated and the nucleophilic attack will occur by electron pait at the carbon atom and the product is cyanide (also called nitrile).
