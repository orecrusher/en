## Lead recovery from PbZrO3 using wet ball
Â Â· Lead recovery from lead zirconate (PbZrO(3)) ceramics was investigated using a wet ball-mill treatment in H(2)SO(4) aqueous solution. Subsequently crystalline alpha-zirconium phosphate (alpha-Zr(HPO(4))(2).H(2)O) was synthesized using a hydrothermal technique in order for the resource recovery of zirconium in the wastewater after the wet ball-mill treatment.

## Ball Mill 
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5â€“10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.
