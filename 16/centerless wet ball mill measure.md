## Lead recovery from PbZrO3 using wet ball
 · Lead recovery from lead zirconate (PbZrO(3)) ceramics was investigated using a wet ball-mill treatment in H(2)SO(4) aqueous solution. Subsequently crystalline alpha-zirconium phosphate (alpha-Zr(HPO(4))(2).H(2)O) was synthesized using a hydrothermal technique in order for the resource recovery of zirconium in the wastewater after the wet ball-mill treatment.

## Ball Mill 
Ball mills tumble iron or steel balls with the ore. The balls are initially 5–10 cm diameter but gradually wear away as grinding of the ore proceeds. The feed to ball mills (dry basis) is typically 75 vol.-% ore and 25% steel. The ball mill is operated in closed circuit with a particle-size measurement device and size-control cyclones.

Ball mills are rather inefficient and typically require 10–20 kW·h of electric power to make a tonne of rawmix. The Aerofall mill is sometimes used for pre-grinding large wet feeds. It is a short large-diameter semi-autogenous mill typically containing 15% by volume of very large (130 mm) grinding balls.
