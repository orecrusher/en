## Igneous Rock Identifiion 
Igneous Rocks. Igneous rocks (fiery rocks) are made when molten material inside or outside the earth cools and becomes solid. This melted rock is called magma when it is inside the earth. When magma finds its way to the surface through cracks or volcanoes it is called lava. When lava cools on top of the earth's surface it forms extrusive

## [Solved] Which one of the following is NOT an igneous rock?
Igneous Rocks. Igneous rocks are crystalline solids that form directly from the cooling of magma. This is an exothermic process (it loses heat) and involves a phase change from the liquid to the solid-state. Igneous rocks are given names based upon two things: composition (what they are made of) and texture (how big the crystals are)

Igneous rocks: These rocks are formed after the solidifiion of molten rock minerals (also known as magma) caused by the explosion of lava. It is of two types: intrusive and extrusive Intrusive igneous rocks: When crystallization takes place below the earth's surface the rock so formed are intrusive igneous rocks.

## The Geology of Rare Earth Elements
The principal concentrations of rare earth elements are associated with uncommon varieties of igneous rocks namely alkaline rocks and carbonatites. Potentially useful concentrations of REE-bearing minerals are also found in placer deposits residual deposits formed from deep weathering of igneous rocks pegmatites iron-oxide copper-gold deposits and marine phosphates ( Table 2 ).

Well let me be clear that the assumption in your question is not strictly true at all. Non-metallic minerals are found everywhere and there is no bias for non-metallic minerals to be more abundant in sedimentary rocks compared to any other type.

## 4 Igneous Processes and Volcanoes – An Introduction to Geology
4.1.3 Igneous Rock Bodies. Igneous rocks are common in the geologic record but surprisingly it is the intrusive rocks that are more common. Extrusive rocks because of their small crystals and glass are less durable. Plus they are by definition exposed to the elements of erosion immediately. Intrusive rocks forming underground with larger stronger crystals are more likely to last.

## Gold 
Most gold mined in Australia today cannot be seen in the rock it is very fine grained and mostly has a concentration of less than 5 grams in every tonne of rock mined. The feasibility of mining low concentrations of gold largely depends on the price of gold. Gold is bought and sold every day on international gold markets.

## Photos of Natural Platinum Ore Platinum and Palladium ore 
Platinum and palladium are found with gold in ores of the Boss mine in the Yellow Pine district Clark County near Moapa in eastern Nevada. The ore minerals here are associated with quartz that replaces dolomite along vertical fractures. Granite porphyry intrudes the dolomite and no basic igneous intrusive rocks are known in this region.
