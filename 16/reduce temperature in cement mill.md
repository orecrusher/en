The performance of water-reducing admixtures used in concrete is affected by the weather conditions to which the concrete mixture is exposed. The most used WRAs are lignosulfonate naphthalene and polycarboxylate. However they react differently to weather conditions especially to air temperature. Therefore it can be useful to evaluate how temperature affects admixture performance.

## Reducing energy consumption of a raw mill in cement 
 · Cement production in the world is currently about 1.6 billion ton per year. About 2% of the electricity produced in the whole world is used during the grinding process of raw materials .While total electrical energy consumption for cement production is about 100 kWh/ton of cement roughly two thirds are used for particle size reduction .
