 · Fig 1 A typical open pit iron ore mine. On the basis of mining methods iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two egories namely manual mining and mechanized mining. Large iron ore mines are mechanized mines while manual mining methods are employed in the small mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores.

## Goa's iron ore mining stuck at a crossroad
 · Three years since iron ore mining was shut down due to a court order various stakeholders of Goa's mining industry are looking at all possible solutions to resume it. Ranging from the extension of mining leases auctioning of mines setting up a state-owned mineral corporation or a cooperative the stakeholders have diverse solutions for the resumption of mining.

## What is Iron Ore? (with pictures) 
Iron ore is any rock or mineral from which iron can economically be extracted. It comes in a variety of colors including dark gray bright yellow deep purple and rusty red. The iron comes in the form of iron oxides such as magnetite hematite limonite goethite or siderite. Economically viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron.

## Why Is Iron Ore Valuable? Behind the Scenes of Production 
 · Iron Ore Extraction. Most iron ore mining takes place in surface or open-pit mines. Usually heavy machinery removes the top layer of the ground over a wide area and exposes the iron ores. In some cases miners dig shafts into the earth with side tunnels that allow them to follow the layer of ore.

 · The deposit was discovered in 1844 and ore was first mined there in 1848 as per the State of Michigan's website. Among the four types of iron ore deposits found in this area are magnetite and hematite ore. In Minnesota magnetite iron ore is mined mainly in the Mesabi iron range one of the four ranges that make up the Iron Range of Minnesota.

Iron Ore Market. Over the last 40 years iron ore prices have been decided in closed-door negotiations between the small handful of miners and steelmakers which dominate both spot and contract markets. Traditionally the first deal reached between these two groups sets a benchmark to be followed by the rest of the industry.

4.1.1 Iron Ore Mining There are two basic methods of mining iron ore. These are: • Surface mining or open-pit mining • Underground or shaft mining To be competitive iron mining must be done on a very large scale. Surface mining is the preferred choice although there are exceptions. Small low-capacity mines have rapidly disappeared.
