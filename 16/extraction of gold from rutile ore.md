## Feasibility study of the new rutile extraction process 
It is found that rutile can be produced from common natural ilmenite ores not only by the reduction as the conventional titanium-rich slag process but also by an oxidation. Then the oxidation experiment was conducted in air using Australian ilmenite ore to obtain rutile as one of the coexistent phases.

## Where does rutile come from? 
Titanium is extracted from its ore rutile - TiO2. It is first converted into titanium(IV) chloride which is then reduced to titanium using either magnesium or sodium. The ore rutile (impure titanium(IV) oxide) is heated with chlorine and coke at a temperature of about 1000°C.

Extraction of Metals. Extraction of Titanium.. The extraction of titanium uses the Kroll process. Titanium ore is called rutile. Rutile contains titanium dioxide - TiO 2. Titanium dioxide is converted into titanium chloride - TiCl 4.. Titanium is more reactive than carbon but it is not extracted by electrolysis because titanium chloride is covalent and therefore does not conduct electricity.
