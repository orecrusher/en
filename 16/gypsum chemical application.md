## How Much Gypsum Can You Add To Soil? 
Gypsum for soil remedies this problem by breaking down compacted soil to allow good drainage and nutrient absorption essential in plant growth. However applying too much gypsum in the soil may also mean eliminating essential nutrients from the soils such as aluminum iron and manganese. Removal of these nutrients may lead to poor plant growth.
