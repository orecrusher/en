## Mercury Usage in Gold Mining and Why It Is a Problem
 · How Mercury Is Used in Gold Mining. First mercury is mixed with the materials containing gold. A mercury-gold amalgam then is formed because gold will dissolve in the mercury while other impurities will not. The mixture of gold and mercury is then heated to a temperature that will vaporize the mercury leaving behind the gold.

## What are the different types of mining and how do they differ?
 · A rarely used process of mining material In-Situ or solution mining is the process of pumping a solution into the ore body which dissolves the ore and is then extracted by a second pump. This method is used most in mining uranium deposits with the Beverey Uranium Mine in South Australia being the nations first operating In-Situ Uranium Mine.
