If you prepare concrete with your ration then the concrete will have too much sand. Too much sand causes shrinkage and this will not give high-density concrete. Hence use 1:2:3 for good strength and 1:2.5:3.5 for moderate strength. If you want to increase strength then reduce the water content and use Chemical admixtures like super plasticisers.
