The crushed ore is then transported to the mill site for crushing grinding classifiion and concentration. The second stage grinding is a wet operation which requires initial flotation and water to make a slurry. The hydrocyclone operates between each grinding operation to classify the type of particles: fine or coarse (Long et al. 1998).

## Iron Ore Analysis Process Optimization Solutions 
Decreasing ore grades of existing or new iron ore deposits require predictive solutions to efficiently sort and blend iron ore for optimal and profitable beneficiation and downstream processing. Elemental and mineralogical composition as well as predictive models for the upgradability based on metallurgical parameters such as washable constituents play an important role for iron ore producers.
