## Homemade Strength: Concrete Weights
 · Eventually though you want to find some cheap used iron plates because concrete weights are not a long term solution in my opinion. Even if they hold up you'll eventually run out of space on the bar. Now I suppose you could probably get something like 500 lbs. on the bar using a combination of iron and concrete weights.
