## Best practices: Drilling and blasting : Pit Quarry
 · The traditional method of drilling and blasting is to treat the two items as separate processes. A driller comes in to drill a hole; a blasting company puts explosives in the hole and blasts it. If you keep these two items separate you cannot always achieve the best results. It's not "chemical crushing" as [Hissem] and I call it.

The existence of a model for the prediction of fragmentation from blasting and the need of feeding the fragments into a fixed primary crusher what ever the variability of the rock properties suggested the need to develop a procedure able to combine a blast model with the well known Bond equation for size reduction.
