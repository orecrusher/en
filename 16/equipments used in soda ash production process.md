## What is Soda Ash? 
 · Soda ash also known as sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) is an alkali chemical refined from the mineral trona or naturally occurring sodium carbonate-bearing brines (both referred to as natural soda ash) the mineral nahcolite (referred to as natural sodium bicarbonate from which soda ash can be produced) or manufactured from one of several chemical processes (referred to as synthetic soda ash).
