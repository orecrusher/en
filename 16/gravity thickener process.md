## Thickener 
In the process of thickening (also called sedimentation) the solids in a suspension settle under the influence of gravity in a tank and form a thick pulp. This pulp and the clear liquid at the top of the tank can be removed continuously or intermittently. In comparison with filtration thickening offers the advantage of low operation costs

LDHB gravity thickening is a kind of solid-liquid separation equipment based on gravity sedimentation. When working the solid particles suspended in the pulp in the concentrator vertebral body settle under gravity and the upper part becomes clear water so that the solid and liquid can be separated.

 · PROCESS DESCRIPTION AND DESIGN PARAMETERS With gravity thickening sedimentation and further consolidation of the suspended sludge solids occurs under the influence of gravity. A clear-water zone should be able to form in the upper section of the thickener in which the solids particles or sludge floes can freely settle.

How a Thickener Works - Mineral Processing Metallurgy. Thickening or dewatering may be defined as the removal of a portion of the liquid from a pulp or slime made up of a mixture of finely divided solids and liquids. The early methods of thickening employed plain flat-bottomed tanks into which the pulp was fed until the tank was full.

## Thickeners 
Thickeners should be viewed as a continuous settling and thickening process. When the Thickener is in a steady state the solids are being withdrawn at the same rate as which they are being fed. Therefore a principle of mass in equal to the mass out should be observed and instruments for measuring both the feed as well as the underflow density and flow is recommended.
