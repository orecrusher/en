 · Cement production begins with limestone a sedimentary rock. Once quarried it is mixed with a silica source such as industrial byproducts slag or fly ash and gets fired in a kiln at 2700 degrees Fahrenheit. What comes out of the kiln is called clinker. Cement plants grind clinker down to an extremely fine powder and mix in a few additives.

A basic mixture of mortar can be made using the volume proportions of 1 water : 2 cement : 3 sand. Most of the student activities can be conducted using this basic mixture. Another "old rule of thumb" for mixing concrete is 1 cement : 2 sand : 3 gravel by volume. Mix the dry ingredients and slowly add water until the concrete is workable.
