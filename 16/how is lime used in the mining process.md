## Lime in Flotation and Recovery Processes 
Lime is used extensively in the recovery of gold and silver. Ores either run-of-mine milled autoclaved or roasted are combined with lime and a cyanide solution. The cyanide dissolves the gold and silver. Lime maintains proper pH in the cyanide solution keeping it in the liquid phase and preventing the formation of hydrogen cyanide gas and its loss into the atmosphere.

## What are the main methods of mining? 
There are four main mining methods: underground open surface (pit) placer and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels beach sands or other environments.

Lime is cheap and easy to obtain and has strong alkalinity. In the process of flotation of sulfide minerals it is usually used as a pH adjuster to increase the pH of the pulp. (1) Adjust the concentration of heavy metal ions in the slurry to form poorly soluble compounds. This is an important adjustment method to eliminate some harmful ions.

## What can be done to prevent or clean up acid mine drainage 
Water flowing through active or abandoned mine sites can become polluted by the material being mined[1]. By far the most common mine drainage problem is that of acid mine drainage (AMD). Sulfuric acid is produced when water interacts with sulfur-bearing materials in the presence of oxygen and common bacteria[1]. The acidic water formed by this process can dissolve many metals
