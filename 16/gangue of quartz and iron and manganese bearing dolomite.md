If the gangue mineral in an iron ore is predominantly quartz reverse flotation is usually used in the cleaning stage to improve the concentrate grade. Figure 9.13 presents a typical flow sheet for processing an oxidized iron ore containing about 30% Fe using a combination of SLon magnetite separators and reverse flotation. The ore is mainly composed of magnetite hematite martite and quartz.

Mineralogically the alluvial deposits are composed mainly of detrital quartz feldspars and grains of zircon and traces of ilmenite.

Gangue minerals mainly comprise quartz chlorite dolomite and locally stilpnomelane. Magnetite most of which appears to replace original haematite is plentiful in a few veins notably the Bonsor Vein at Coniston (P246074) where mine records suggest the proportion of this mineral increases with depth.

 · Where dolomite is seen directly replacing calcite it nucleates on the Fe-rich calcite due to the increased compatibility of the Fe-bearing calcite lattice relative to the pure calcite. Both reactions are interpreted as fluid-mediated replacement reactions which use the crystallography and elemental chemistry of the calcite.

## The Quartz Page: Occurrence
Common gangue minerals are quartz calcite and dolomite. They often occur in a layered manner that reflects the order of deposition of different minerals. Another term for a vein that carries ores and gangue minerals is lode : the "Mother Lode" of the Sierra Nevada California is the source of the gold that was found in placer deposits: a quartz vein that contained native gold.
