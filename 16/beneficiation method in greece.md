## Recent advances in beneficiation for low rank coals 
 · Coal beneficiation is one of the most effective methods for removing minerals (such as gangues and pyrite) and pollutants (such as sulfur) before the burning of coal. In general the beneficiation process of low rank coals is more difficult to achieve than that of bituminous and/or anthracite coals. However about 50% of the world's total coal

## A Review on the Beneficiation Methods of Borate Minerals
The modern boron appliions have adsorbed the mineral processors' attention to improve typical boron mineral's (BM) beneficiation methods. In this regard dry treatment and pretreatment processes—such as magnetic separation and calcination as environmentally friendly methods due to their minimal or zero adverse effect on the environment—need more consideration.
