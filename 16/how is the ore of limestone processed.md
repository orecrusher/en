## Limestone extraction 
Limestone mining is done out in the open. Once studies show the existence of stone at the site the extraction is made by separating the rock in quarry benches and dividing it into blocks. Before beginning the quarrying process a resource analysis is made.

## The 5 Main Steps in Processing Diamond Ore 
 · Here are the main steps in processing diamond ore. A number of these processes use equipment from Multotec: 1- Crushing. The first step in kimberlite ore processing is crushing. This process reduces large run-of-mine lumps into smaller pieces making them easier to handle and releases or liberates the diamonds to be recovered in subsequent steps.

 · Smelting: The pellets are smelted in a furnace along with coke—coal that has been processed into almost pure carbon—and limestone. The intense heat breaks the iron-oxygen bonds in the ore releasing the oxygen as gas which bonds with carbon gas being released from the burning coke to form CO2 (carbon dioxide).

## How is Iron Refined from Ore? (with pictures)
Iron ore consists of oxygen and iron atoms bonded together into molecules. To create pure iron one must deoxygenate the ore leaving only iron atoms behind which is the essence of the refining process. To purify and strengthen iron materials like coke are mixed in with it to remove oxygen. To coax the oxygen atoms away from the ore requires

 · Sintering: A Step Between Mining Iron Ore and Steelmaking. The USGS defines iron ore as a mineral substance which when heated in the presence of a reductant will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3). It's a major ingredient in steel.

## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron 
 · The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process. The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace. These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.
