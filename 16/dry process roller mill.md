Roller mills are also more sensitive to instantaneous changes in the feed rate than are other pieces of process equipment. Feeding a roller mill directly from a screw conveyor or bucket elevator will cause surges in the feed rate that the roller mill "sees" instantaneously unless some damping system such as a surge hopper is used.
