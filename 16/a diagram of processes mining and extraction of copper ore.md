## Copper Mining and Extraction Sulfide Ores
Copper can be extracted from its ore by: Underground: sinking a vertical shaft into the Earth to an appropriate depth and driving horizontal tunnels into the ore. Open pit: 90% of ore is mined by this method. Ores near the surface can be quarried after removal of the surface layers.

2.2 OVERVIEW OF COPPER EXTRACTION The copper extraction process begins at an open cut mine where Copper Ore is blasted and removed via Excavators and Tip Trucks. The ore is fed to a Crusher where it is broken down to a specified maximum size and passed through to a conveyor. When the crushed ore falls onto the

This method of mining allows for the extraction of salts and metals from an ore body without resorting to conventional mining methods such as underground mining. There are plenty of advantages to using in-situ mining.
