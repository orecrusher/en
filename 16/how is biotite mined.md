## Biotite Mineral Geology and Uses 
 · Biotite is a mineral found in many rocks but you may not recognize its name because it's often lumped together with other related minerals under the name "mica."Mica is a group of phyllosilies or sheet silies characterized by forming parallel sheets of silie tetrahedrons composed of silicon oxide Si 2 O 5.Various forms of mica have different chemical compositions and some unique

## Biotite mica: The mineral Biotite information and pictures
Biotite is a very common form of mica. It is named in honor Jean Baptiste Biot (1774 - 1862) a French physicist mathematician and astronomer who researched the mica minerals for their optical properties. Because of Biotite's abundance its presence is usually lacking in collections except for it being an accessory mineral to other minerals.

## PHLOGOPITE (Potassium Magnesium Aluminum Silie Hydroxide)
Biotite tends to form in a wider range of conditions than phlogopite which is limited mostly to ultramafic rocks and magnesium rich marbles and pegmatites. Phlogopite like other micas has a layered structure of magnesium aluminum silie sheets weakly bonded together by layers of potassium ions.
