## Effects of Acid Rain on Buildings 
The effects of acid deposition on modern buildings are considerably less damaging than the effects on ancient monuments. Limestone and calcareous stones which are used in most heritage buildings are the most vulnerable to corrosion and need continued renovation. Evidence of the damaging effect of acid deposition can be seen throughout the world.

## How Does Limestone Affect the Environment?
 · Limestone mining can pollute water and create sinkholes. When limestone dissolves while it's still in the ground caves and gullies form a natural phenomenon known as karst. Although this doesn't hurt the environment in its natural form once the limestone is mined out sinkholes can form and disrupt underground waterways.

 · Summary. The damaging effects of acid rain have led to strong pressure on industry to minimize the release of harmful reactants. Acid rain is rainfall whose pH is less than 5.6 the value typically observed due to the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide. Acid rain is caused by nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide produced by both natural processes and the combustion of fossil fuels.

## What Does Acid Rain Do To Limestone? 
Answer (1 of 3): The acid rain will dissolve the limestone when they become in contact. This happens because limestone is a porous rock so it absorbs the rain and the acidity dissolves it.

## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? 
 · Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This is not very soluble so rocks don't dissolve very quickly. But if you add an acid you add hydrogen ions (H+) which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3- ions which are very soluble in water and the limestone will dissolve. Or if there is more acid two hydrogen ions will
