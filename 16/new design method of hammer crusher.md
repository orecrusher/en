## Impact Crusher 
Impact Crusher. The impact crusher (typically PE series) is widely used and of high production efficiency and good safety performance. The finished product is of cube shape and the tension force and crack is avoided. Compared with hammer crusher the impact crusher is able to fully utilize the high-speed impact energy of entire rotor.

Dynamic impact is the crushing method used by Pennsylvania Crusher Impactors. Attrition Attrition is a term applied to the reduction of material by scrubbing it between two hard surfaces. Hammermills operate with close clearances between the hammers and the screen bars and they reduce by attrition combined with shear and impact reduction.
