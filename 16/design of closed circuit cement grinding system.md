Characteristics of open- and closed-circuit grinding systems. Primarily designed for open-circuit grinding the cement mill is also applicable for use in combination with powder separators to form a closed circuit grinding system. It is compatible with both dry type and wet type grinding and also supports synchronous grinding and drying.

Grinding systems are either 'open circuit' or 'closed circuit.' In an open circuit system the feed rate of incoming clinker is adjusted to achieve the desired fineness of the product. In a closed circuit system coarse particles are separated from the finer product and returned for further grinding.

 · For instance Sottili and Padovani showed that industrial closed-circuit grinding of cement clinker using a tumbling ball strongly benefits from GA appliions. Within their study the use of GAs led to a decrease of the medium residence time of the material inside the mill by 25% which in turn resulted in a 100% increase of the product recirculation.
