## Mining Process Steps Of Zinc 
Mining Process Steps Of Zinc. Copper processing is a complied process that begins with mining of the ore less than 1 copper and ends with sheets of 99.99 pure copper called hodes which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore copper oxide and copper sulfide undergo two different processes hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy respectively

## Mining and Extraction: Oxide Ores 
Copper is refined from ores in the ground either through underground or open-pit mines. Most of the copper ores mined today are oxide or sulfide ores. Extraction of sulfide ores is covered in more detail in Copper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide Ores (11–14) but is introduced here because an important by-product of this process is used for the extraction of oxide ores.

zinc concentrate and waste tai lings. About 90% to 98% of the cadmium present in zinc ores i s recovered in the mining and beneficiating stages of the extraction process. Zinc concentrate is converted from zinc sulfide to zinc oxide by roasting and at the same time most of the sulfur is removed as sulfur dioxide.

Back to Rocks and Minerals Articles Peter Russell and Tharsika Tharmanathan Zinc (Zn) is a bluish-white shiny metal that is fragile at room temperature but becomes malleable at 100 degrees Celsius. Zinc is one of the most common elements in the Earth's crust. It is found in soil air and water and is present in food. Zinc was used in Rome and China more than 2000 years ago

## Zinc 
We mine around 350 ktonnes of zinc in concentrates from our mines in Tara Garpenberg and the Boliden area every year. The majority of this goes to our zinc smelting plants in Kokkola and Odda where we produce around 500 ktonnes of zinc every year. They also handle recycled zinc. A large part of our zinc is sold to European sheet metal producers.
