## The Karst Landforms and Cycle of Erosion 
The water containing limestone in solution seeps through the roof of caverns in the form of a continuous chain of drops. A portion of the roof hangs on the roof and on evaporation of water a small deposit of limestone is left behind contributing to the formation of a stalactite growing downwards from the roof.

## What Is the Difference Between Sandstone Limestone 
 · Sandstone is formed from the breakdown of larger rocks due to weathering and erosion as well as from processes that occur within the rock usually biologic but sometimes chemical in nature. Limestone often forms from whole or pieces of a variety of organisms that contain calcium carbonate such as mollusks echinoids and corals.

Limestone formation took place millions of years ago. There are a variety of Limestone Uses and the Limestone Reserves are found in many countries around the world. The rocks in the earth's crust continuously undergo changes in their composition which leads to formation of other rocks. Each rock has a unique formation process.

## How Limestone is Formed
Limestone Formation. Limestone is any rock that is made mostly from calcium carbonate but there are several types. It forms with carbonate rocks were deposited in seawater and continue to form as coral reefs in shallow seas. Marine limestone comes together when seawater with high concentrations of chemicals as they dissolve.

## Limestone Formation Erosion 
Formation.Stacks typically form in horizontally-bedded sedimentary or volcanic rocks particularly on limestone cliffs.The medium hardness of these rocks means medium resistance to abrasive and attritive erosion.A more resistant layer may form a capstone.Cliffs with weaker rock such as claystone or highly jointed rock tend to slump and erode too quickly to form stacks while harder.

## Water Erosion 
Karst topography is a layer of limestone close to the surface that creates deep valleys caverns and sinkholes. In an area where this limestone near the surface groundwater erosion can change the shape of the land. In these areas streams are rare because water sinks into the limestone. When the roof of a cave collapses the result is a sinkhole.

## Geology: Formation Of Gorges In Limestone Areas
 · Limestone. Layers of sedimentary limestone often interspersed with sandstone and shale make up the base material of limestone gorges. The rock was formed from sediment falling on the floors of the ancient shallow seas that covered much of the Earth 200 to 300 million years ago. The sediment was deposited over long periods of geological time.

## Lateral bedrock erosion and valley formation in a 
 · Lateral bedrock erosion outpaced vertical incision during our two-year study period. Modern erosion rates measured at erosion pins in limestone and shale bedrock reveal that shale erosion rate is a function of wetting-and drying cycles while limestone erosion rate is controlled by discharge and fracture spacing.

## Sinkholes 
 · Sinkholes are common where the rock below the land surface is limestone carbonate rock In these areas the formation of underground cavities can form and astrophic sinkholes can happen. The slow downward erosion eventually forms small surface depressions 1 inch to several feet in depth and diameter.

This formation is nearly 300 meters thick and consists of algal limestone and dolomite of Middle Cambrian age (around 550 million years). The age of the "collapse" is unresolved but may actually be an active physical-chemical process that affects large carbonate units in the desert surface environment.

## Limestone features above ground 
Limestone features above ground. Limestone scenery above ground (karst scenery) includes: Swallow hole. Surface water passes over an impermeable rock until it reaches permeable limestone. The water passes over the limestone and erodes vertical joints to form swallow holes. Over time the swallow hole increases in size as the result of erosion

## Learning Geology: Limestone
 · Limestone is partially soluble especially in acid and therefore forms many erosional landforms. These include limestone pavements pot holes cenotes caves and gorges. Such erosion landscapes are known as karsts. Limestone is less resistant than most igneous rocks but more resistant than most other sedimentary rocks.

## How Does Weathering Affect Limestone? 
 · Follow Us: Weathering creates underground caves and passages in limestone in addition to depressions and other unusual dips and grooves on the surface. Karst is landscape formed from the weathering of limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock created from the remains of dead sea creatures and is predominately made up of calcium carbonate.
