6.1.1 Lead and Zinc Ore Mining Lead and zinc ore is nearly always mined below the surface of the ground. Some veins of ore lie as deep as several thousand feet but most deposits lie close to the surface. Lead and zinc ore is mined almost exclusively in underground operations though a few surface operations do exist.

In surface mining the rock barrier on top of the deposit is removed to access the ore. However sometimes such deposits occur too far below to access them from the surface. In such cases they are extracted by leaving the overlying rock intact and accessing the deposit directly from below.

## Surface mining – strip open pit mountaintop removal 
Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed. It is the other way of underground mining in which the overlying rock is left behind and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.. Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface

## Strip Mining 
Surface mine design principles emanate from the operational characteristics of surface mining which are drilling and blasting spoil handling coal removal and haulage. Except in a few circumstances overburden in surface mining requires the rock to be fractured by explosives to allow it to be excavated.
