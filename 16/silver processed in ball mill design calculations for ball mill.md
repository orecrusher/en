## How to Make a Ball Mill: 12 Steps (with Pictures) 
 · Ball mills are a special instrument used to break up hard solids into a fine powder. They are similar to rock tumblers in that the instrument is a rotating container filled with heavy balls to grind the substance into powder. Ceramic material crystalline compounds and even some metals can be ground up using a ball mill.

## Ball Mill: Operating principles components Uses 
 · A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 – 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

## Ball Mills 
8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1–1.5 times the shell diameter ( Figure 8.11). The feed can be dry with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating or slurry containing 20–40% water by weight.

## The working principle of ball mill 
 · The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force.

## Optimizing your SAG mill operation 
 · The mill discharge from these mills consists of slurry which goes to the ball mills for further grinding and coarse pebbles/rocks which are crushed and sent back to the mill. To maximize the capacity of these circuits the general practice is to use grates with pebble ports (reaching 100 mm) instead of normal grate openings to increase the pebble removal.

 · In Grinding selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum/ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do. Often the ball used in ball mills is oversize "just in case". Well this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and/or mill liner wear and tear.
