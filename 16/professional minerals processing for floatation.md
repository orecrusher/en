## Thickener technology for mineral processing – CSIROpedia
 · Most of the world's minerals pass through solid-liquid separation in a thickener at some point in their processing. Thickeners are used to either: concentrate mineral slurries prior to extraction of commodities. create a liquid free of solids for subsequent extraction of dissolved metals. wash contaminants from mineral solids.

Flotation. Background. Froth flotation is the follow-on operation after comminution and classifiion in the process of liberating and separating minerals by exploiting the differences in physical properties of the different minerals that make up an ore. Froth flotation is achieved when particles are separated based on their surface potential.

## Lime use and functionality in sulphide mineral flotation 
 · Flotation is an electrochemical process in which mineral surfaces react with reagents in solution to form hydrophobic complexes that impart flotability to the mineral particles. In sulphide minerals flotation these reactions involve oxidation of some species and reduction of others resulting in selective adsorption of collector on the mineral surfaces ( Chander 1988 ).

## Recovering Gold through the Froth Flotation Process 
 · Along with mechanized mining equipment froth flotation dramatically improved the efficiency of gold mines. Thanks to this process miners and refiners are able to extract quality minerals from ore at lower grades than has been previously possible – making it perhaps the most important mining industry innovation of the 20th century.

## Modelling for froth flotation control: A review 
 · 1. Introduction. Froth flotation is the largest tonnage separation in mineral processing by which valuable mineral is separated from waste rock. Advances in control and optimisation of the froth flotation process are of great relevance since even very small increases in recovery lead to large economic benefits (Ferreira and Loveday 2000 Maldonado et al. 2007).
