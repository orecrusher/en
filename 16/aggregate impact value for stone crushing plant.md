Crushed stone is produced by crushing quarry rock boul-ders cobbles or large-size gravel. Crushed air-cooled blast-furnace slag is also used as fine or coarse aggregate. The aggregates are usually washed and graded at the pit or plant. Some variation in the type quality cleanli-ness grading moisture content and other properties is expected.
