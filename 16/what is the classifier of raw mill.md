## Rawmill 
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into "rawmix" during the manufacture of cement. Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln which transforms it into clinker which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement and has a large effect upon the

## 12 Tile Manufacturing/Production Process Step
The raw materials are taken in a ball mill and them grinded with water for certain hours. The grinding media is usually alumina because it has good wear resistance and good density. This process is known as wet grinding. The raw material will be obtained in a slurry form at the end of the wet grinding process.
