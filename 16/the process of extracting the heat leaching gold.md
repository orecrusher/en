## What are the Cyanide
 · The most studied cyanide-free gold recovery methods include water chlorination bromination and iodination thiosulfate thiourea and cyanide substitute gold recovery methods. 1. Water Chlorination Process. The gold leaching chemical reaction equation of this cyanide-free gold recovery method is as follows: 2Au+3Cl2+2HCl→2HauCl4.

## Cyanide Leaching Chemistry Gold Cyanidation
 · Cyanide Leaching Chemistry Gold Cyanidation. The reactions that take place during the dissolution of gold in cyanide solutions under normal conditions have been fairly definitely established. Most agree that the overall cyanide equation for leaching and cyanidation of gold is as follows: 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O2 + 2 H20 = 4 NaAu (CN)2 + 4 NaOH.

## the process of extracting the heat leaching gold
Gold Extraction and Recovery Processes Semantic Scholar. available for the extraction of gold metal from its ores. Amongst these methods cyanidation is the most common method used in the leaching of gold from the ore. This process involves the dissolution of gold containing ores in dilute cyanide solution in the presence of lime and oxygen.

## In the cyanide process for extraction of gold and silver 
Silver and gold are extracted by the cyanide process (Mac Arthur - Forrest process). After the preliminary crushing and concentration by froth floatation process the ore (crushed auriferous rocks in the case of gold) is leached with dilute (0.4 - 7%) solution of sodium cyanide made alkaline by adding lime kept agitated by a current of air.

## the process of extracting the heat leaching gold
One example of a leaching process that uses vat leaching is gold cyanidation the process of extracting gold from low grade ores. In this process a dilute solution of sodium cyanide is used to leach the Au into solution. The concentration is usually 0.01 0.05 % cyanide or 100 500ppm.

## How to Refine Gold by the Acid Method 
Add the water/precipitant solution slowly to the acid. Immediately the acid will change to a muddy brown appearance as brown particles of gold form in the water. This brown "mud" is despite its appearance pure gold. 9. Give the precipitant about 30 minutes to do its job. 10.
