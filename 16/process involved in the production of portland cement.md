## Cement Manufacturing Process 
 · Cement Manufacturing Process. Cement is a material which is used to bind other materials together. Binding means it has an effect of gluing the substances together due to cohesive and adhesive action and then hardens and sets in order to become permanent. Cement is usually not used on its own; it is mixed with other materials called aggregates

## Cement Manufacturing Process Flow Chart
In the cement manufacturing process most material must be broken such as limestone iron ore clay and coal etc. Limestone is the main raw material for cement production each producing a ton of clinker needs about 1.3 tons of limestone more than 80% of raw material is limestone.

• Chalk is porous and often has high moisture content that leads it to its use in the 'semi-dry/wet' manufacturing process of making cement. This particular process represents some 16% of total production. Shale • Shale is a pure sedimentary rock made of very fine silt clay and quarz. Shale falls in the egory of mudstones.

 · The hot air from the coolers is returned to the pre-heater in order to save fuel in the overall process. The clinker is then ground to produce portland cement. Gypsum is added during the grinding process to control the set rate of the cement. Slag and fly ash can also be added to control other properties of the final product.

## How Concrete is Made 
How Concrete is Made. In its simplest form concrete is a mixture of paste and aggregates or rocks. The paste composed of portland cement and water coats the surface of the fine (small) and coarse (larger) aggregates. Through a chemical reaction called hydration the paste hardens and gains strength to form the rock-like mass known as concrete.
