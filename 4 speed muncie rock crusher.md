## Muncie 4 speed.M21 M22 Rock Crusher? 
 · I was just wondering how many different variations there are of the Muncie 4 speed and which ones are best and for what reason(s). I currently have an M22 Rock crusher in my '56 Chevy pickup and have another M22 that was rebuilt about 6 years ago by my father but never used. I also have what I believe is an M21 but I'm not certain.
